  title: [A typesetting system to untangle the scientific writing process],
  abstract: [
    The process of scientific writing is often tangled up with the intricacies of typesetting, leading to frustration and wasted time for researchers. In this paper, we introduce Typst, a new typesetting system designed specifically for scientific writing. Typst untangles the typesetting process, allowing researchers to compose papers faster. In a series of experiments we demonstrate that Typst offers several advantages, including faster document creation, simplified syntax, and increased ease-of-use.

= Introduction
Scientific writing is a crucial part of the research process, allowing
researchers to share their findings with the wider scientific community.
However, the process of typesetting scientific documents can often be a
frustrating and time-consuming affair, particularly when using outdated tools
such as LaTeX. Despite being over 30 years old, it remains a popular choice
for scientific writing due to its power and flexibility. However, it also comes
with a steep learning curve, complex syntax, and long compile times, leading to
frustration and despair for many researchers.

fn main() {
  println!("Hello world");
