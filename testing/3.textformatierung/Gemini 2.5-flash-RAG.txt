= Introduction to Typst Formatting

This document serves as a quick reference for common text formatting in Typst. As a markup language, Typst allows for easy application of styles directly within your text.

== Basic Text Styles

You can easily emphasize text using simple markup. For example, to make text *bold*, you can enclose it in asterisks. If you want to make text _italic_, you can use underscores.

Let's look at an example:
In this paragraph, we will highlight some *important terms* and _key concepts_ related to document preparation. Typst makes it simple to achieve a professional look with minimal effort.

To start a new paragraph, simply add a blank line between your lines of text.

== Code Snippets

Typst provides excellent support for displaying code. You can include inline code snippets or larger code blocks.

For inline code, use backticks: The `main` function is the entry point of the program. We can define a variable using `#let x = 10`.

For multi-line code blocks, use triple backticks:

```typ
// This is a Typst code block
#let greet(name) = {
  // A simple function definition
  [Hello, ] + name + [!]
}

#greet("Typst User")
== Mathematical Formulas

Typst excels at typesetting beautiful mathematical formulas. You can include them inline with your text or as separate, displayed blocks.

For inline mathematical expressions, use dollar signs: The well-known formula for the area of a circle is [$ A = pi r^2 
]

 r $] is the radius.

For block-level equations, use dollar signs with spaces around the content:

You can also write more complex equations. For instance, the quadratic formula is given by:

This formula helps us find the roots of a quadratic equation.

**Explanation of the code:**

*   `#set text(font: "New Computer Modern")`: This line uses a [set rule](https://typst.app/docs/reference/layout/set/) to change the default font for the entire document to "New Computer Modern".
*   `= Introduction to Typst Formatting`: This creates a top-level heading.
*   `== Basic Text Styles`: This creates a second-level subheading.
*   `*bold*`: Encloses text in asterisks to make it **bold**.
*   `_italic_`: Encloses text in underscores to make it *italic*.
*   `` `inline code` ``: Encloses text in single backticks for `inline code`.
*   ```` ```typ ... ``` ````: Encloses a block of code in triple backticks. The `typ` after the opening backticks indicates the language for syntax highlighting.
*   `[$ math formula $]`: Encloses mathematical content in dollar signs for inline math mode.
*   `[$ math formula $]`: Encloses mathematical content in dollar signs, with spaces around the content (`[$ E = mc^2 $]`) to display it as a separate, centered block equation.

This example covers the most common formatting needs and should give you a solid foundation for your Typst documents!
