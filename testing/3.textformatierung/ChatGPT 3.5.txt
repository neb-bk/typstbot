= Sample Text Formatting in Typst

This is a sample paragraph demonstrating different text formatting in Typst.

Here is some *italic* text using the `emph` function:
#emph("This is emphasized.")

Here is some **bold** text using the `strong` function:
#strong("This is bold.")

You can also have both: #strong(emph("Bold and italic text"))

Here is some `inline code` using the `raw` function:
#raw("let x = 42;")

## Math Examples

Inline math using `$...$`: $E = mc^2$

You can also use display math with the `math` function:
#math(block: true)[
  \int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a)
]

You can write fractions, roots, sums, and more:
#math(block: true)[
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left( -\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)
]

Enjoy formatting your documents in Typst!
Notes:
#emph(): for italic (emphasized) text.

#strong(): for bold text.

#raw(): for inline code.

$...$: for inline math.

#math(block: true)[...]: for display (block) math.
