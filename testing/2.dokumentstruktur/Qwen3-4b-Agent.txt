To properly generate a document with a title, table of contents, sections, and a table within a “Listings” section using Typst, you need to ensure correct syntax and structure. Here’s the corrected and well-organized version of your code:

✅ Correct Typst Code


Copy block


#title("My Document")
#toc()

#section("Introduction")
#para("This is the introduction section.")

#section("Background")
#para("Background information here.")

#section("Algorithm")
#para("Algorithm details.")

#section("Conclusion")
#para("Conclusion summary.")

#section("Listings")
#table([
  ["Header 1", "Header 2"],
  ["Data 1", "Data 2"]
])
🔍 Explanation
#title("My Document")
Sets the document title correctly. This is the proper way to define the title in Typst.

#toc()
Generates a table of contents based on the sections defined later.

#section("Section Name")
Creates a new section with the specified name. This is used for each section in the document.

#para("Text")
Adds a paragraph of text to the current section.

#section("Listings")
Creates a section labeled “Listings”.

#table([...])
Defines a table with rows and columns. Each row is an array of strings. This is the correct syntax for creating a table in Typst.

📝 Notes
The #listings command is not used for inserting a table. Instead, #table is used to define the table directly.
The #toc() command will automatically include all sections in the table of contents.
The structure is clean and follows Typst’s syntax for defining documents.
📄 Result
This code will produce a document with:

A title: “My Document”
A table of contents
Sections for “Introduction”, “Background”, “Algorithm”, and “Conclusion”
A “Listings” section containing a single table with two rows and two columns
