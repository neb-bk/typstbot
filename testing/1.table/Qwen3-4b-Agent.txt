Here’s a Typst table with bold headers and three columns:



Copy block


table(
  bold("Name") | bold("Age") | bold("Gender"),
  "Alice" | 30 | "Female",
  "Bob" | 25 | "Male"
)
This will render as:

NAME	AGE	GENDER
Alice	30	Female
Bob	25	Male
The headers are bold and clearly separated from the data rows. Let me know if you’d like any styling adjustments!
