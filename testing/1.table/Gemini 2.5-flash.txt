I can certainly help you create a table in Typst! Here's the code for a table with three columns, bold headers, and a clear separation between the header and the content, as you requested.

#table(
  columns: 3, // Define 3 columns
  align: (left, center, center), // Align content: left for name, center for age and gender
  // Header row
  [ *Name* ], // Bold header for Name
  [ *Age* ],  // Bold header for Age
  [ *Gender* ], // Bold header for Gender
  // Rule to separate header from body
  hline(stroke: 1pt + black), // Horizontal line below the header
  // Table content
  [ Alice ], [ 30 ], [ Female ],
  [ Bob ], [ 25 ], [ Male ],
)

This Typst code will generate a table with "Name", "Age", and "Gender" as bold headers, separated by a line from the data below. The data includes Alice and Bob with their respective details.
