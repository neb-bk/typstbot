To insert your image with a caption and make it referenceable in Typst, use the following solution:

typst
// Place this where you want the figure to appear
#figure(
  image("images/test.png", width: 80%),
  caption: [My test image],
) <fig:test-image>

// Reference elsewhere in your document like this:
As shown in @fig:test-image, ...
Key components:

image("images/test.png") - Loads your image (adjust path if needed)

width: 80% - Optional scaling (remove or adjust as needed)

caption: [My test image] - Sets your figure caption

<fig:test-image> - Creates reference label (prefix fig: is convention)

@fig:test-image - Reference syntax for citations

Features:

Automatic figure numbering

Caption appears below image

Central alignment by default

Reference updates automatically if figure number changes

To customize:

typst
#figure(
  align(center, image("images/test.png")),
  caption: [My test image],
  numbering: "Figure 1", // Custom numbering format
  supplement: [See: ],   // Prefix for references
) <fig:test-image>
Ensure your image path is relative to your Typst document's location. The reference will appear as "Figure 1" (or your custom numbering) in the generated PDF.
