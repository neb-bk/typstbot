To add your image with a caption and make it referenceable, use the figure function with a label. Hereâ€™s the code:



Copy block


#figure(
  image("images/test.png"),
  caption: [
    "My test image"
  ],
) <test-image>
Explanation:
Image Path: "images/test.png" is used as the file path.
Caption: The caption "My test image" is enclosed in square brackets as a content block.
Label: <test-image> labels the figure for referencing.
Reference: Use @test-image elsewhere in the document to cross-reference this image.
This setup ensures the image is properly displayed with a caption and can be referenced later.
