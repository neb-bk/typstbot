To include an image with a caption and make it referenceable in Typst, use the figure environment with image, caption, and label. Hereâ€™s the code:



Copy block


figure(
  image("images/test.png"),
  caption("My test image").label("my-image")
)
Explanation:
image("images/test.png"): Inserts the image from the specified path.
caption("My test image"): Adds the caption text.
.label("my-image"): Attaches a label for referencing later.
Reference elsewhere:
Use ref("my-image") in other parts of the document to link to this image. For example:



Copy block


See Figure 1: ref("my-image")
This ensures the image is properly embedded, labeled, and cross-referenced.
