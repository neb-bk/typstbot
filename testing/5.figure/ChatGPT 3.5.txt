To insert your image located at "images/test.png" into a Typst document with a caption and make it referenceable from other parts of the document, you can use the figure function along with image, caption, and a label. Here's how you can do it:

typst
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
#figure(
  image("images/test.png", width: 80%),
  caption: [My test image],
  label: "fig:test-image",
)
Explanation:
#figure(...) creates a figure with a caption and a referenceable label.

image("images/test.png", width: 80%) includes the image and scales it to 80% of the text width (you can adjust this as needed).

caption: [My test image] sets the figure's caption.

label: "fig:test-image" assigns a unique label you can use to reference the image later.

Referencing the image:
To reference this image elsewhere in your document, use:

typst
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
@fig:test-image
This will render as something like “Figure 1” depending on the figure’s number.

Let me know if you want the image centered, resized differently, or floated beside text!
