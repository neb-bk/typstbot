To resolve the “file not found” error when including your image in Typst, follow these steps:

1. Verify the Image Path
Ensure the image test.png is located in the correct directory relative to your document. If your document is in the root of your project, the image should be in:



Copy block


images/test.png
If the image is in a different folder (e.g., assets/images/test.png), adjust the path in your code accordingly.

2. Check File Existence
Confirm the file test.png exists in the images folder. If not, place it there or adjust the path.

3. Use Correct Syntax
In Typst, use the following syntax to include the image with a caption:



Copy block


#image("images/test.png", width: 200, height: 200)
caption("My test image")
Ensure the path is relative to the document’s location.

4. Build Process
If you’re using a build tool (e.g., typst build), make sure the image is included in the project directory. Sometimes, temporary directories (like C:\Users\f2004\AppData\Local\Temp) are used for intermediate files, but the image should be in the project folder, not the temporary one.

5. Alternative: Absolute Path
If the image is in a different location, use an absolute path (if allowed by your environment), but this is less common in Typst.

Example Fix
If your document is in C:\project\main.typ and the image is in C:\project\images\test.png, the code is correct. If the image is missing, place it in the images folder.

Final Note
If the error persists, check the file extension (ensure it’s .png) and verify no typos in the filename. Let me know if you need further help!
