Here’s a Type function in Typst that takes a string and a separator, then outputs the string with each character separated by the provided separator:



Copy block


fn charSeparated(str: str, sep: str) => join(chars(str), sep)
Explanation:
chars(str) converts the input string into a list of individual characters.
join(..., sep) combines the list of characters into a single string, inserting the sep between each character.
Example:


Copy block


charSeparated("hello", "-") // Output: "h-e-l-l-o"
This function is concise, leverages Typst’s built-in functions, and adheres to the requirements.
