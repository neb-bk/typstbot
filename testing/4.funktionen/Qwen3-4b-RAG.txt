To achieve the goal of splitting a string into individual characters and then joining them with a specified separator, we can write a function that uses string operations to perform this task.

✅ Objective
Given a string s and a separator sep, return a new string where each character of s is separated by sep.

🧠 Approach
In many programming languages, a string can be split into individual characters by using an empty string as the delimiter. For example:


python

Copy block


s = "abc"
s.split("")  # returns ['a', 'b', 'c']
Once we have a list of individual characters, we can join them using the provided separator.

🧩 Function Implementation

rust

Copy block


fn split_string(s: &str, sep: &str) -> String {
    s.split("").join(sep)
}
s.split("") splits the input string into a vector of individual characters.
join(sep) joins these characters using the provided separator sep.
This function works correctly for any separator, including empty strings.

🧪 Examples

rust

Copy block


let result = split_string("abc", ",");
println!("{}", result); // Outputs: a,b,c

let result2 = split_string("hello", " ");
println!("{}", result2); // Outputs: h,e,l,l,o

let result3 = split_string("rust", "");
println!("{}", result3); // Outputs: r,u,s,t
📝 Note
The function assumes that the language or environment supports splitting on an empty string.
If not, an alternative is to use a method like chars() that returns an iterator of characters, which can be converted into a vector and joined.
✅ Final Answer

rust

Copy block


fn split_string(s: &str, sep: &str) -> String {
    s.split("").join(sep)
}
