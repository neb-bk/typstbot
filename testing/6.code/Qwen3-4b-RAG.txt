To achieve the desired layout, you need to make the following adjustments:

1. Change the grid to have three columns
This allows you to place the title, “Document”, and the image in separate columns, ensuring a clean and organized layout.

2. Adjust the image size
The image is currently set to 30% width, which may be too large. Reduce this to a more reasonable size, such as 20%.

3. Place elements correctly in the grid
The title should be aligned to the left in the first column.
The “Document” text should be centered in the second column.
The image should be aligned to the right in the third column.
✅ Final Code (Example in a Markdown-style pseudocode):

markdown

Copy block


grid.columns: (1fr, 1fr, 1fr)

grid.row: [
  align(left)[_ #title _],
  "Document",
  align(right)[image:20%]
]

grid.hline()
📝 Notes:
grid.columns: (1fr, 1fr, 1fr) ensures that each column takes an equal share of the width.
align(left)[_ #title _] places the title on the left.
"Document" is centered in the middle column.
align(right)[image:20%] places the image on the right with a width of 20%.
grid.hline() draws a horizontal line after the grid.
This layout is clean, readable, and responsive. It ensures the title is prominent, the text is in the center, and the image is appropriately sized and positioned.
