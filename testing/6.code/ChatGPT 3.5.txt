set page(

    bottom: 8pt, // Adds spacing between header and body (horizontal line is at the bottom of header)
    grid(
      columns: (1fr, auto, 1fr), // Three columns: title | label | logo
      align(left)[_ #title _],
      align(center)[Document],
      align(right)[#image("images/logo.png", width: 20%)], // Smaller image
      spacing: 6pt, // Vertical spacing between rows (like grid.hline and content)
    )
  )
)
✅ Explanation
width: 20%: This makes the logo image smaller than the previous 30%. You can tweak it more if needed.

grid(columns: (1fr, auto, 1fr)): This creates a three-column layout:

Left: Title

Center: "Document" text

Right: Logo

box(bottom: 8pt, ...): This wraps the grid in a box that adds space below the header—moving the content higher above the horizontal line.

spacing: 6pt: Adds some breathing room between the content and any grid lines like grid.hline() (which we removed here since you're adjusting spacing manually).
