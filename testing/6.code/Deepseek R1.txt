Based on your requirements, I've modified your header grid to include the "Document" text between the title and logo, reduced the image size, and increased spacing between the content and horizontal line. Here's the updated code:

typst
set page(
  header: grid(
    columns: (1fr, auto, 1fr),
    gutter: (0pt, 6pt),  // Added vertical spacing between rows
    inset: (
      top: 10pt,   // Increased top padding
      bottom: 4pt, // Reduced bottom padding
      x: 0pt,
    ),
    // Left-aligned title
    align(left)[_ #title _],
    // Centered "Document" text
    align(center)[Document],
    // Smaller right-aligned logo
    align(right)[#image("images/logo.png", width: 20%)],
    // Horizontal line with top margin
    grid.hline(stroke: (thickness: 0.5pt), above: 4pt)
  ),
)
Key improvements made:

Image size reduced from 30% to 20% width

Added "Document" text centered between title and logo using a 3-column grid layout

Increased vertical spacing:

Added 6pt gutter between rows

Increased top padding to 10pt

Added 4pt space above the horizontal line

Reduced bottom padding to 4pt

Improved line styling with explicit thickness

The grid now has three columns (left content, centered text, right content) with:

Title left-aligned in first column

"Document" centered in middle column

Smaller logo right-aligned in third column

Horizontal line spanning all columns with additional spacing above it

This creates a balanced header with proper spacing and the additional text element you requested. You can adjust the spacing values (gutter, inset, above) further if needed.
