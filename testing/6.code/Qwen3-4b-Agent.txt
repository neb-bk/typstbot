To address your requirements, here’s the modified Typst code:



Copy block


#set columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr
#set inset: 0pt 10pt 0pt 0pt

grid(
  columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr,
  inset: 0pt 10pt 0pt 0pt,
  align(left)[_ #title _],
  align(center)[#text("Document")],
  align(right)[#image("images/logo.png", width: 20%)],
  grid.hline()
)
Changes Made:
Image Size: Reduced the image width to 20% for a smaller size.
Vertical Spacing: Increased the inset value to 10pt to move the horizontal line upward, creating more space between the content and the line.
“Document” Placement: Added the text "Document" in the middle column of a 3-column grid to position it between the title and image.
This should make the layout more balanced and visually aligned with your requirements. Let me know if you’d like further adjustments!
