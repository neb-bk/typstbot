It's essentially an invisible space that glues two words together. While it *can* be used, the documentation suggests using a `box` for phrases that must not break, as `sym.space.nobreak` can be tricky with copy-pasting.\n\n*   **`sym.wj` (World Joiner):** This symbol indicates that *no line break should occur at its position*. It's a zero-width symbol that's primarily about preventing a break within a single 'word' or connecting elements tightly without any visual space. It can also be used creatively to remove unwanted spacing between joined elements.\n\n**When to use which:**\n\n*   Use **`sym.space.nobreak`** (or preferably `box`) when you want to ensure a phrase consisting of *multiple words* (that would normally be separated by a space) stays on one line. Example: `Hello#sym.space.nobreak;world` (though `#box[Hello world]` is better).\n\n*   Use **`sym.wj`** when:\n    *   You want to prevent a line break *within* what Typst might consider a single word or a closely-knit sequence of characters/symbols. Example: `Thisi#sym.wj;saword` to force `Thisisaword` to be one unit.\n    *   You need to join two elements (like a symbol and text, or two symbols) such that *no* space appears between them, and they are treated as a single unit for line-breaking purposes. Example: The `hbar` definition from the `physica` package.\n\nIn essence, `sym.space.nobreak` is about non-breaking *space*, while `sym.wj` is about non-breaking *connection* between characters/symbols.\n\ntyp```\n#set page(width: 9em)\n\n// Demonstrating sym.space.nobreak (alternative for #box[two words])\n#box[two words] // Recommended\ntwo#sym.space.nobreak;words // Alternative\n\n// Demonstrating sym.wj (to prevent break within a word or join tightly)\nno#sym.wj;breakword\n\n// Example of sym.wj to remove spacing between joined elements\n#let just-hbar = move(dy: -0.08em, strike(offset: -0.55em, extent: -0.05em, sym.planck))\n#let hbar = (sym.wj, just-hbar, sym.wj).join()\n$ a #just-hbar b, a hbar b$\n```",

No automatic space around them.\n*   **`\"punctuation\"`**: For commas, semicolons, etc. Typically has space *after* it, but not before.\n*   **`\"opening\"`**: For opening delimiters like `(`, `[`, `{`. Typically has space *before* it, but not after, and can influence vertical alignment within `lr()`.\n*   **`\"closing\"`**: For closing delimiters like `)`, `]`, `}`. Typically has space *before* it, but not after.\n*   **`\"fence\"`**: For vertical bars used as fences (e.g., absolute value). Has space on both sides.\n*   **`\"large\"`**: For large operators like `sum`, `integral`. Has specific spacing and often takes limits above/below.\n*   **`\"relation\"`**: For relational operators like `=`, `<`, `>`. Has significant space on both sides.\n*   **`\"unary\"`**: For unary operators like `+` (positive sign), `-` (negative sign). Less space than binary operators.\n*   **`\"binary\"`**: For binary operators like `+`, `-`, `*` (multiplication). Has moderate space on both sides.\n*   **`\"vary\"`**: For variable-size operators that can grow (e.g., `sum`).\n\nUnderstanding these classes allows for fine-tuning the visual presentation of mathematical expressions.",

Named arguments apply to the whole function call, but their position matters relative to the semicolons.\n\nExample demonstrating `none` for missing elements and mixing with named arguments:\n\n```typ\n#let fun(..args) = {\n    repr(args.pos())\n    repr(args.named())\n}\n\n$ // Using a math block to display the result for clarity\nfun(1, 2; gap: #3em, 4)\n$ // This will output: ((1, 2,), (gap: 3em, 4,)) (or similar, depending on exact parsing)\n```\n\nCrucially, as shown in the documentation, if a named argument is placed *after* a list of elements but *before* a semicolon, it will be incorrectly parsed as part of the current array of positional arguments, not as a named argument for the function itself. For instance, `mat(1, 2; 4, gap: #3em)` would fail because `gap: #3em` would be treated as content for the second row, not as a matrix parameter.",

    "answer": "Choosing the right function (`box`, `block`, `figure`) depends on how you want the content to interact with the document's flow and its semantic meaning:\n\n*   **`box`**: Use `box` when you want to wrap content inline with text. The boxed content will not break the paragraph flow and can be thought of as part of a sentence or a line of text. It's ideal for small graphical elements, highlighted words, or icons that need to stay integrated within the text line.\n    ```typ\n    This sentence has an inline #box(fill: yellow)[highlighted word] that doesn't break the line.\n    ```\n\n*   **`block`**: Use `block` when you want to treat content as a separate paragraph. The content inside a block will always appear on its own line, breaking the surrounding text flow. It's suitable for self-contained pieces of content that need to be distinctly separated from the main text, but without the semantic meaning of a 'figure' (e.g., a simple colored background for a note that isn't a figure).\n    ```typ\n    Before the block, we have some text.\n    #block(fill: lightblue, inset: 0.5em)[This is a distinct block of text, separate from paragraphs above and below.]\n    After the block, the text continues.\n    ```\n\n*   **`figure`**: Use `figure` for elements that are intended to be formal figures in a document, such as images, tables, code listings, or large diagrams. Figures typically have captions, are often centered, and can be cross-referenced. The `figure` function handles the layout and semantic structure appropriate for such elements, ensuring they are correctly placed and can be listed in a table of figures.\n    ```typ\n    See the example in @chart-diagram.\n    \n    #figure(\n      rect(width: 100%, height: 5em, fill: red)[This represents a diagram],\n      caption: [A sample diagram illustrating a concept.],\n    ) <chart-diagram>\n    ```",

    "answer": "Curly braces `{}` are used to enter *code mode* in Typst. Unlike square brackets `[]` which create content, braces allow you to write arbitrary Typst script code, including variable declarations, conditional logic (`if`), loops, and function calls that return values rather than directly producing content. They are essential for implementing logic within your documents.\n\nConsider this comparison:\n- `[]`: For creating structured content (text, markup, elements).\n- `{}`: For writing executable code and logic.\n\nExample of using braces for logic within a function:\ntyp```\n#let calculate_area(width, height) = {\n  // This is code mode, we can perform calculations\n  let area = width * height\n  // We return the calculated value, which is then converted to content\n  [The area is: #area]\n}\n\n#calculate_area(10, 5)\n```",

The fundamental rule is: **you cannot use variables outside of the scopes they are defined in.** The only exception is the file root, from which elements can be imported.\n\nSimilarly, `set` and `show` rules, which modify document properties or transform elements, only affect content and elements *within their specific scope*. They do not leak out into parent or sibling scopes.\n\nExample demonstrating scope limitations:\ntyp```\n#{ // This is a new scope\n  let a = 10; // 'a' is defined within this scope\n  #text(red)[Inside scope: a = #a]\n}\n// #text(blue)[Outside scope: a = #a] // This would cause an error because 'a' is not accessible here.\n\n#[ // This is another scope (content block)\n  #show \"true\": \"false\" // This rule applies only within this content block\n  This is true.\n]\n\n// The show rule above does not apply here\nThis is true.\n```",

If multiple expressions are present, their results are typically joined (concatenated for content/strings) and returned as a single value.\n\nTo explicitly control what a function returns and avoid joining unwanted values, you can use the `return` keyword. This allows you to specify exactly what value should be sent back by the function, potentially exiting early.\n\nExample of default return vs. explicit `return none`:\ntyp```\n#let default_return_example() = {\n  \"First part\"\n  // This '42' will be implicitly returned (joined with \"First part\")\n  42\n}\n\n#let explicit_return_example() = {\n  \"Some long text that should not be returned\"\n  // Crazy numbers that should not be returned\n  \"2e7\"\n  return none // Explicitly return nothing\n}\n\n#text(blue)[Default Return: #default_return_example()]\n#text(red)[Explicit Return (should be empty): #explicit_return_example()]\n```",

An argument that has a default value is automatically considered a 'named argument'. This means you must specify the argument's name when calling the function if you want to pass a value to it, rather than relying on positional order.\n\nThe syntax for defining a default value is `argument_name: default_value`.\n\nExample:\ntyp```\n#let generate_greeting(name: \"Guest\", language: \"English\") = [\n  Hello #name, you are viewing this in #language.\n]\n\n// Using default values for both arguments\n#generate_greeting()\n\n// Overriding only the 'name' argument (must be named)\n#generate_greeting(name: \"Alice\")\n\n// Overriding both arguments (both must be named)\n#generate_greeting(name: \"Bob\", language: \"Spanish\")\n\n// Overriding only the 'language' argument\n#generate_greeting(language: \"French\")\n```",

The `set` rule's effect will be confined to that scope.\n\ntyp```\n#set text(font: \"Arial\", fill: black) // Default text style for the whole document\n\n= My Document\n\nThis is some regular text in the document.\n\n#[ // Start a new scope (content block) for the special heading style\n  #set heading(font: \"New Computer Modern\", fill: purple)\n\n  = Introduction\n  This is the introduction section with the custom heading style.\n\n  == Subsection 1\n  More content within the custom heading scope.\n]\n\n= Conclusion\nThis heading will revert to the default style because it's outside the custom style's scope.\n\nRegular text after the special section.\n```\nIn this example, the `set heading` rule is placed inside a content block `#[...]`.

    "answer": "The core difference lies in what each construct is designed to contain and implicitly produce:\n\n1.  **Function body with `[]` (Square Brackets):**\n    *   **Purpose:** The content inside `[]` is treated directly as a *content block*. This is ideal for functions that primarily produce static text, markup, or a fixed layout structure.\n    *   **Return/Produce:** The function inherently 'returns' or produces the formatted content that is written inside the brackets. There's no 'code execution' in the traditional sense; it's a direct content construction.\n    *   **Example:** `let greeting() = [Hello, world!]` - This function directly outputs the content `Hello, world!`.\n\n2.  **Function body with `{}` (Curly Braces):**\n    *   **Purpose:** The content inside `{}` is executed as Typst *script code*. This allows for variables, calculations, conditional logic, loops, and calls to other functions.\n    *   **Return/Produce:** The function 'returns' the value of the *last expression* evaluated within the braces. If the last expression evaluates to content, that content is produced. If it evaluates to a number, string, boolean, etc., that value is returned and can be converted to content if placed in a content context.\n    *   **Example:** `let add(a, b) = { a + b }` - This function returns the numerical sum. `let dynamic_text(name) = { \"Hello, \" + name }` - This function returns a string, which can become content.\n\nIn essence, `[]` is for direct content assembly, while `{}` is for programmable logic that *can* result in content, but also other data types.",

This is a crucial point related to Typst's fundamental principle of immutability for most values, including arrays and dictionaries.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **`values.at(0)`**: This expression *retrieves* the value at index 0 (which is `1` in the example). The full expression `(1 = 3)` is then evaluated as a boolean comparison, which results in `false`.\n2.  **`dict.launch`**: This expression attempts to *access* a field named `launch` in the dictionary.

If you tried to define this without `context`, it would capture the page dimensions and text color from where it was *defined*, not where it's *used*. If the page layout changes (e.g., landscape vs. portrait, different margins) or the text color is set differently on later pages, the watermark would be mispositioned or incorrectly colored.\n\n**Contrast with a function that doesn't need context:**\nA purely mathematical function, like `multiply(a, b) = a * b`, or a function that simply formats static text like `format-name(first, last) = [Name: #first #last]`, do not need context because their behavior doesn't depend on the document's dynamic state or styling.",

It provides the final, stable value that the state will hold.\n\nThe `location` argument is crucial because it restricts the scope of content that will be re-evaluated to determine the final state. This greatly increases compilation speed by allowing Typst to avoid unnecessary recalculations across the entire document. It also helps in resolving potential \"conflicts\" by localizing the convergence process, ensuring that the final value is determined based on updates relevant to that section of the document.\n\nHere's the example:\n\ntyp```\n#let x = state(\"x\", 5)\nx = #x.display() \\ // x starts at 5\n\n#locate(loc => [\n  The final x value is #x.final(loc) // Calculates final x from this location onwards\n])\n\n#x.update(-3)\nx = #x.display() // x becomes 2\n\n#x.update(n => n + 1)\nx = #x.display() // x becomes 3\n```\n\nIn this output, `The final x value is 3` because even though the `final` call happens earlier in the document, it correctly accounts for the subsequent updates (`-3` and `+1`) to `x` that occur later in the document flow, resulting in a final value of `5 - 3 + 1 = 3`.",

    "answer": "A layout \"not converging\" occurs when Typst enters an infinite loop of recalculations because a state variable's value continuously changes based on its own final value, or another state's final value, in a circular dependency. Typst attempts to converge the layout by making up to 5 passes, but if the state never stabilizes, it gives up and issues a warning.\n\nThis typically happens when you try to update a state based on its `final` value *within* a `locate` block that influences that `final` value. The following example demonstrates this:\n\ntyp```\n#let x = state(\"x\", 5)\nx = #x.display() \\ // Initial x value (5)\n\n#locate(loc => [\n  // let's set x to final x + 1\n  // This creates a circular dependency: x's value depends on its final value,\n  // which in turn depends on this update, leading to non-convergence.\n  #x.update(x.final(loc) + 1)\n  #x.display() // This will cause the warning after 5 attempts\n])\n```\n\n**WARNING**: layout did not converge within 5 attempts\n\nThis occurs because inside the `locate` block, `x.update(x.final(loc) + 1)` tells Typst to set `x` to its final value plus one. But for Typst to determine the `final(loc)` value, it needs to know the result of this update. This creates a logical paradox: if `x.final(loc)` is 5, the update makes it 6. But if it's 6, the update makes it 7, and so on. Since `x` never stabilizes, Typst cannot converge the layout and eventually gives up.",

    "answer": "The \"dark magic\" warning highlights that while Typst's state management (`state` variables, `locate`, `final`) is powerful, it introduces significant complexity and potential pitfalls. The implications for a user are:\n\n1.  **Complexity and Debugging Difficulty:** State interactions can be hard to reason about, especially with multiple updates and `locate` calls. Debugging can be challenging as the exact order of evaluation and recalculation is not always obvious.\n2.  **Non-Convergence Risks:** As demonstrated, circular dependencies can lead to the layout failing to converge, resulting in a warning and potentially an incomplete or incorrect document if not addressed.\n3.  **Performance Impact:** While `final`'s `location` argument helps, poorly managed states or excessive reliance on dynamic updates based on `final` values can lead to more layout passes and slower compilation times.\n4.  **Unexpected Behavior:** The \"time travel\" nature of `state.at` or complex `final` calculations can lead to values that are not immediately intuitive based on the sequential reading of the document.\n\n**Precautions to take:**\n\n*   **Use Sparingly:** Only use state variables when absolutely necessary for features like dynamic numbering, counters, or cross-reference data. Avoid them for simple, static values.\n*   **Simplify Interactions:** Keep state updates and dependencies as straightforward as possible. Avoid complex, interdependent updates that create circular logic.\n*   **Understand `final`'s Scope:** Be acutely aware that `final(loc)` considers updates *up to the point where `loc` is defined and passed to `final`*. Updates *after* that point will not influence *that specific* `final` value.\n*   **Test Thoroughly:** When implementing states, test your document extensively to ensure the values converge and are as expected across all sections.\n*   **Avoid Cyclic Dependencies:** Never update a state based on its own `final` value (or the `final` value of another state it directly influences) within a `locate` block that determines that `final` value. This is the primary cause of non-convergence.\n*   **Document State Logic:** For complex state-driven features, document the logic and flow of state updates to aid future understanding and maintenance.",

When `measure` is called directly, it doesn't inherently know the final rendering context or the styles that will be applied at the element's actual position in the document. Therefore, it might measure the element using default or a different set of styles.\n\nThe `context` block captures the current styles and environment at the point it is defined, allowing `measure` to accurately determine the size of the element *as if it were placed at that exact location with those styles*. This ensures the measurement reflects the actual rendered size.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating the effect:\ntyp```\n#let content_to_measure = [Hello World!]\n\n// Measure without context, may use default text size\n#let size_default = measure(content_to_measure)\n[Default measured size: Width = #size_default.width, Height = #size_default.height]\n\n#set text(18pt)\n// Measure with context, capturing the 18pt text size\n#let size_18pt = context {\n  measure(content_to_measure)\n}\n[Measured size at 18pt: Width = #size_18pt.width, Height = #size_18pt.height]\n\n#set text(8pt)\n// Measure again with context, capturing the 8pt text size\n#let size_8pt = context {\n  measure(content_to_measure)\n}\n[Measured size at 8pt: Width = #size_8pt.width, Height = #size_8pt.height]\n\n#content_to_measure // The actual content will be 8pt here due to the last set.\n```",

Even if there's only one matching metadata element, it will still be wrapped in an array.\n\n*   `.first()`: This method is called on the array returned by `query`. It retrieves the first element from that array. For metadata, which typically has unique labels, this is usually the single metadata element you're interested in.\n*   `.value`: Once you have the specific metadata element, `.value` is used to extract the actual content or data that was stored within that metadata element when it was defined using `#metadata(\"your content\")`.\n\nIn essence, `first().value` gets the *content* of the *first* matching metadata element found by the query.",

This is particularly important for 'time travel' scenarios.\n\nIn the provided 'time travel' example, `s.at(query(<here>).first().location())` needs to be wrapped in `context` because `s.at()` accesses the state's value *at a specific location*. Without `context`, `s.at()` would try to evaluate `s.get()` immediately at the current location, which doesn't reflect the state at the queried `location`.\n\nHere's a simpler illustration:\n\n```typ\n#let total_count = state(\"count\", 0)\n\n// Increment the counter at various points\n#total_count.update(x => x + 1)\nFirst point. \n\n#total_count.update(x => x + 1)\nSecond point. <second>\n\n#total_count.update(x => x + 1)\nThird point. <third>\n\n#v(1em)\n// Query the state *at* the location of 'second' label\n#let second_loc = query(<second>).first().location()\n\n#if second_loc != none {\n  [Value of count at 'second' point: #context total_count.at(second_loc)]\n} else {\n  [Label 'second' not found.]\n}\n\n// Query the state *at* the location of 'third' label\n#let third_loc = query(<third>).first().location()\n\n#if third_loc != none {\n  [Value of count at 'third' point: #context total_count.at(third_loc)]\n} else {\n  [Label 'third' not found.]\n}\n\n#total_count.update(x => x + 1)\nFourth point.\n```",

    "instruction": "What is the relationship between `query`, `selector`, and `location` in Typst? How do they work together to enable document introspection?",
    "answer": "These three components are fundamental to document introspection in Typst:\n\n1.  **`selector`**: This defines *what* you are looking for in the document. A selector can be a specific element type (e.g., `heading`, `figure`, `text`), an element with specific properties (e.g., `selector(it => it.func() == text and it.lang == \"en\")`), or a label (e.g., `<my-label>`). It can also include positional filters like `.before(here())` or `.after(here())`.\n\n2.  **`query`**: This is the function that performs the search. You pass a `selector` to `query`, and it traverses the document to find all elements that match that selector. It returns an array of `location` objects.\n\n3.  **`location`**: Each object in the array returned by `query` is a `location`. A `location` object represents a specific point or position within the document where a matching element was found. Crucially, a `location` object *also contains the element itself* (or a reference to it) and provides methods to get information about that element, such as its content (`.body`), its properties (e.g., `.caption` for a figure), or its page number (`.page()`).\n\n**How they work together:**\nYou define *what* you want to find using a `selector`. You then use `query` to *find* instances of that selector throughout the document, resulting in an array of `location` objects. Finally, you *interact* with these `location` objects to extract information about the found elements or to perform actions based on their position or properties. This powerful combination allows for dynamic content generation, cross-referencing, and advanced layout adjustments based on the document's structure and content.",

    "answer": "In Typst, 'states' provide a mechanism to maintain and update mutable values across a document's layout process. Unlike regular variables, which are often read-only within function scopes, states allow you to define a value that can be modified by content that appears later in the document flow.\n\nThey are necessary because Typst's compilation process is designed to be highly optimized and parallelizable. If variables could be freely modified from anywhere, it would make it difficult to determine the final value of a variable without processing the entire document sequentially, which would hinder performance. States offer a controlled way to introduce mutability.\n\nFor instance, if you try to modify a variable declared outside a function directly within that function, Typst will raise an error because variables from outside the function are read-only. States overcome this limitation by allowing you to define a 'stateful' variable whose value can be updated explicitly.\n\nConsider this non-compiling example that demonstrates the need for states:\n```typ -norender\n#let x = 0\n#let compute(expr) = {\n  // THIS DOES NOT COMPILE: Variables from outside the function are read-only\n  x = eval(\n    expr.replace(\"x\", str(x))\n  )\n  [New value is #x.]\n}\n\n#compute(\"10\") \\\n#compute(\"x + 3\")\n```\nInstead, you would use a state variable:\n```typ\n#let s = state(\"x\", 0)\n#let compute(expr) = [\n  // updates x current state with this function\n  #s.update(x =>\n    eval(expr.replace(\"x\", str(x)))\n  )\n  // and displays it\n  New value is #context s.get().\n]\n\n#compute(\"10\") \\\n#compute(\"x + 3\") \\\n#compute(\"x * 2\") \\\n#compute(\"x - 5\")\n```",

    "answer": "You create a new state in Typst using the `state()` function. It takes a unique string identifier as its first argument and can optionally take an initial value as its second argument.\n\n**Purpose of the Identifier:**\nThe identifier (e.g., `\"state-id\"`, `\"x\"`) is crucial because Typst uses it to uniquely identify and manage the state across your document. All states with the same ID refer to the *same underlying state*. This means if you declare `state(\"my-state\", 0)` in one place and `state(\"my-state\", 10)` in another, they will both refer to the same state, and their initial values might conflict or lead to unexpected behavior depending on their order in the document flow. It's generally advised to ensure state IDs are unique to avoid collision issues.\n\n**Examples:**\n1. **Creating a state without an explicit initial value:**\n   ```typ\n   #let my_state_a = state(\"unique-id-a\")\n   The value of my_state_a is initially: #context my_state_a.get()\n   ```\n   *Note: If no initial value is provided, the state's initial value will be `none`.*\n\n2. **Creating a state with an initial value:**\n   ```typ\n   #let my_state_b = state(\"unique-id-b\", 100)\n   The initial value of my_state_b is: #context my_state_b.get()\n   ```\n\n3. **Demonstrating ID collision (bad practice but for understanding):**\n   ```typ\n   #let x = state(\"shared-id\", 5)\n   #let y = state(\"shared-id\", 10) // This refers to the same state as x\n\n   Value of x: #context x.get() \\\n   Value of y: #context y.get()\n   \n   #x.update(20) // Update via x\n   New value of x: #context x.get() \\\n   New value of y: #context y.get() // y reflects the change made via x\n   ```\n   As seen above, even though `x` and `y` were assigned different initial values in their definitions, because they share the same ID, they ultimately refer to the same underlying state.

  {
    "instruction": "What is the purpose of the `context` keyword in Typst when working with states? How does it affect when state values are evaluated?",
    "answer": "The `context` keyword in Typst is used to define a block of content or an expression that **depends on the layout state** of the document. When you use `context`, the enclosed expression or content is evaluated at the 'layout stage' of Typst's compilation process, rather than the initial 'scripting stage'.\n\n**Purpose and Evaluation Timing:**\nTypst processes documents in stages. At the initial scripting stage, it evaluates markup and code, defines variables, and sets up structures. However, the final layout (e.g., page breaks, element positions, and crucially, the final values of states that have been updated by preceding content) is determined later.\n\n`context` acts as a 'black box' that captures a snapshot of the document's state *at the point it is laid out*. This means:\n\n1.  **Accessing State Values:** You must use `context` to `get()` the current value of a state. Without it, Typst wouldn't know which version of the state's value you intend to retrieve if it changes later in the document.\n    ```typ\n    #let s = state(\"my-counter\", 0)\n    #s.update(1)\n    #context s.get() // Correct: Retrieves the updated value (1) when laid out\n    // #s.get() // Incorrect: Will cause an error because it's not in context\n    ```\n\n2.  **State Updates:** While `state.update()` itself produces a content element that tells Typst to modify the state, putting `state.update()` *inside* a `context` block has specific implications. An `update` inside a `context` block only affects the state *for content that comes after that `context` block in the document flow*. The `context` block itself cannot 'see' changes it makes internally to a state.\n\n**Illustrative Example:**\n```typ\n#let x = state(\"x-val\", 0)\n\nBefore context: #context x.get() // Current value of x (0)\n\n#context {\n  x.update(3) // This update is scheduled but not visible *within* this context block\n  str(x.get()) // Still shows the value *before* this context block's update takes effect for itself\n}\n\nAfter context: #context x.get() // Now shows the updated value (3)\n```\nIn this example, the first `context x.get()` correctly shows `0`. The `context` block containing `x.update(3)` and `str(x.get())` will output `0` because `x.get()` within that `context` block retrieves the value of `x` as it was *before* this `context` block's scheduled update.

    "answer": "Updating a state's value is done using the `state.update()` method. This method takes either a new value or a function that receives the current state value and returns the new value.\n\n**1. Updating with a Direct Value:**\nThis is straightforward; you simply pass the new value to `update()`.\n```typ\n#let counter = state(\"my-counter\", 0)\n\nInitial value: #context counter.get() \\\n\n#context counter.update(5) // Update the state to 5\n\nValue after direct update: #context counter.get() \\\n```\n\n**2. Updating with a Function (based on current value):**\nThis is very common for incremental changes. The function you provide will receive the current value of the state as its argument, and its return value will become the new state value.\n```typ\n#let total = state(\"accumulator\", 10)\n\nInitial total: #context total.get() \\\n\n// Add 7 to the current total\n#context total.update(current => current + 7) \\\n\nTotal after adding 7: #context total.get() \\\n\n// Multiply by 2\n#context total.update(current => current * 2) \\\n\nTotal after multiplying by 2: #context total.get()\n```\n\n**What `state.update()` returns and its behavior:**\n`state.update()` itself returns a 'content' value (specifically, a `content` type that represents an update instruction). It does *not* immediately return the new state value or any value visible in the scripting context. This content instruction must be placed into the document flow (e.g., by just writing `#context state.update(...)` or `#let _ = state.update(...)` and then placing `_` in the document) for the update to take effect.\n\nIf you call `state.update()` without putting its result into the document flow, the state will not be updated as far as the layout is concerned:\n```typ\n#let x = state(\"example-state\", 0)\n#context x.get() // Outputs 0\n\n#let _ = x.update(3) // The update instruction is created but not put into document flow\n// nothing happens here visible to the layout engine yet\n\n#context x.get() // Still outputs 0, because the update instruction was not laid out\n\n#repr(x.update(3)) // This shows what the content instruction looks like internally\n\n#context x.update(3) // Now the instruction is laid out\n#context x.get() // Finally outputs 3!\n```",

    "instruction": "Explain the concept of 'ID collision' in Typst states. Why is it a problem, and what are the potential consequences of having states with the same ID but different definitions or locations in the code?",
    "answer": "ID collision in Typst states occurs when you define multiple `state()` variables with the exact same string identifier (e.g., `\"my-state\"`). While it might seem like you are creating distinct states, Typst's state management system treats all `state` objects with the same ID as referring to the *very same underlying mutable state variable*.\n\n**Why it's a Problem:**\nTypst determines the final value of a state based on the sequence of `update` operations it encounters in the document flow for that specific state ID. If you have multiple `state()` declarations with the same ID, they all try to initialize or influence the same single state instance.\n\n**Potential Consequences:**\n1.  **Unexpected Initial Values:** If you define `state(\"id\", 0)` and later `state(\"id\", 10)` in different parts of your code, the actual initial value of the shared state can be non-deterministic or depend on the precise order of evaluation in the layout pass, which is often not intuitive. The later definition might override the earlier one or lead to confusion.\n    ```typ\n    #let x = state(\"my-shared-state-id\", 5)\n    #let y = state(\"my-shared-state-id\", 15)\n\n    // Both x and y refer to the same state. The effective initial value will be 15\n    // because y's definition appears later in the code.\n    Initial value from x: #context x.get() \\\n    Initial value from y: #context y.get()\n    ```\n\n2.  **Unintended Side Effects on Updates:** An update operation performed via one variable (e.g., `x.update(...)`) will affect the state that *all* other variables with the same ID (e.g., `y`, `z`) are pointing to. This can lead to bugs where changes in one part of your document unexpectedly alter values used in a seemingly unrelated part.\n    ```typ\n    #let func_a(val) = {\n      let s = state(\"counter-state\", 0) // Shared ID\n      s.update(current => current + val)\n      context s.get()\n    }\n\n    #let func_b(val) = {\n      let s = state(\"counter-state\", 0) // Same shared ID\n      s.update(current => current * val)\n      context s.get()\n    }\n\n    First call (func_a(2)): #func_a(2) \\\n    Second call (func_b(3)): #func_b(3) \\\n    Third call (func_a(10)): #func_a(10)\n    ```\n    In this example, calling `func_a(2)` makes the state `2`. Then `func_b(3)` operates on `2`, making it `6`. Finally, `func_a(10)` operates on `6`, making it `16`. The states are not independent instances as one might initially expect from calling functions separately.\n\n3.  **Debugging Difficulty:** Such issues are hard to debug because the source of a state's value might be far removed from where the unexpected value is observed. The warning provided in the documentation is clear: \"Never allow colliding states.\"\n\n**Recommendation:** Always ensure that each unique conceptual state in your document or library has a truly unique string identifier. For functions that need to create temporary or isolated states, consider generating dynamic unique IDs if necessary, though this is less common and often indicates a need for a different approach (like using argument passing) rather than widespread state creation.",

However, you've encountered an issue where the counter doesn't seem to increment correctly. Review the following code, identify the problem related to state management, and provide the corrected version along with an explanation.",
    "answer": "**Problematic Code:**\n```typ -norender\n#let my_counter = state(\"doc-counter\", 0)\n\n#let next_count() = {\n  // Problem: update is not put into the document flow or context\n  my_counter.update(c => c + 1)\n  // Problem: get is not wrapped in context\n  [Current count: #my_counter.get()]\n}\n\n#next_count() \\\n#next_count() \\\n#next_count() \\\n```\n\n**Identified Problems:**\n1.  **`my_counter.update(c => c + 1)` is not yielding content to the document flow.** While `update()` creates an instruction, that instruction must be placed into the document's layout stream for Typst to process it. Simply calling it in a scripting context (like inside `#let next_count() = { ... }`) does not guarantee it will be executed during layout.\n2.  **`#my_counter.get()` is not wrapped in `context`.** `get()` operations on a state must always be within a `context` block to retrieve the value from the layout pass. Without `context`, Typst doesn't know when to evaluate the state's value.\n\n**Corrected Version:**\n```typ\n#let my_counter = state(\"doc-counter-fixed\", 0)\n\n#let next_count() = {\n  // 1. Return the update instruction as content\n  // 2. Wrap the get operation in context to evaluate at layout time\n  context {\n    my_counter.update(c => c + 1)\n    [Current count: #my_counter.get()]\n  }\n}\n\n#next_count() \\\n#next_count() \\\n#next_count() \\\n\nFinal count: #context my_counter.get()\n```\n\n**Explanation of Correction:**\n1.  **Wrapping in `context`:** By wrapping both `my_counter.update(...)` and `[Current count: #my_counter.get()]` within a `context` block inside `next_count()`, we ensure that:\n    *   The update instruction (`my_counter.update(c => c + 1)`) is effectively placed into the document flow when `next_count()` is called. This tells Typst to increment the state value at that specific point in the layout.\n    *   `my_counter.get()` is evaluated at the layout stage, allowing it to correctly retrieve the state's value *after* the update scheduled by the `context` block has been processed for subsequent content. However, it's important to remember that `context` cannot see its *own* state changes. So, `my_counter.get()` within the same `context` block that performs the update will show the value *before* that specific `context`'s update takes effect for itself. To see the *post-update* value, you'd typically retrieve it in a *subsequent* `context` or just after the update is laid out.\n\n    In the corrected `next_count` function, the `my_counter.update` call produces a content block that modifies the state. When `next_count()` is called and its returned `context` block is laid out, the update is registered. The `my_counter.get()` within the same context block will show the value of `my_counter` *before* the update instruction contained within that specific `context` block is fully applied. Subsequent `next_count()` calls or other `context my_counter.get()` calls will then reflect the changes from previous `context` blocks. The output of the corrected code demonstrates this behavior.",

Now, to make level 1 headings span the full width and be centered with specific styling:\n```typ\n#show heading.where(\n  level: 1\n): it => block(width: 100%)[\n  #set align(center)\n  #set text(12pt, weight: \"regular\")\n  #smallcaps(it.body)\n]\n```\nThis `block(width: 100%)` explicitly makes the heading take full width, overriding the column layout. Similarly, for level 2 headings, you might just want to apply specific text styling without breaking columns:\n```typ\n#show heading.where(\n  level: 2\n): it => text(\n  size: 11pt,\n  weight: \"regular\",\n  style: \"italic\",\n  it.body + [.],\n)\n\n// Example content\n= Heading\n== Small heading\n#lorem(10)\n== Second subchapter\n#lorem(10)\n= Second heading\n#lorem(40)\n\n== Second subchapter\n#lorem(40)\n```\nThis combination of `show` rules allows for a flexible layout where the main content is columnar, but specific elements can be styled and laid out differently.",

    "answer": "In Typst, the distinction between `[content]` and `\"string\"` is crucial for how internal formatting and other Typst elements are handled:\n\n*   **`[content]` (Square Brackets)**: When you use square brackets, you are creating a \"content block.\" This block is fully aware of Typst's markup and can contain other functions, strong/emph text, links, etc. Typst will parse and render any markup within these brackets.\n    *   Example: `#text(red)[This is *important*.]` - The `*important*` will be rendered in bold.\n\n*   **`\"string\"` (Double Quotes)**: When you use double quotes, you are creating a plain string. Typst treats this as literal text. Any characters that look like markup (e.g., `*`, `_`, `#`) will be interpreted as plain characters and will not trigger Typst's formatting engine.\n    *   Example: `#text(red)[\"This is *important*.\"]` - The `*important*` will remain literally `*important*`.\n\nWhile for simple plain text (e.g., just `\"red text\"`), all forms might result in a visually similar output (as the `text` function ultimately produces content), the ability to include markup is the key differentiator.\n\nExample demonstrating the effect of markup:\ntyp```\n#set text(size: 1.2em)\n\n// 1. Content passed directly (implicit first positional argument). Markup is processed.\n#text(red)[This is *bold* and _italic_ text from content.]\n\n// 2. Content passed explicitly as first positional argument. Markup is processed.\n#text([This is also *bold* and _italic_ text from content.], red)\n\n// 3.

It means:\n\n1.  **Uniformity:** All document elements, whether simple text formatting or complex layouts, are ultimately generated by functions. This provides a consistent and unified underlying model.\n2.  **Extensibility:** Because markup is just a shorthand for functions, users can create their own custom functions that behave just like built-in markup, easily extending Typst's capabilities to suit specific needs or establish custom document styles.\n3.  **Flexibility:** You are not limited to predefined markup. If markup doesn't offer what you need, you can always \"drop into\" scripting mode and use functions to achieve precise control and create highly dynamic content.\n4.  **Power:** The scripting engine is not just for advanced tasks; it's the core. This gives Typst immense power to generate dynamic and complex documents programmatically, beyond what a purely markup-based language could do.\n\nExample of how `strong` markup is syntax sugar for a `strong` function call:\ntyp```\n// Markup syntax sugar for bold text:\n*This is bold text.*\n\n// Equivalent function call:\n#strong[This is bold text.]\n```",

This means you need to explicitly use a hash `#` before any script expressions, including `show`, `set`, and function calls.\n*   **Scripting mode `{...}`**: Inside curly braces, the content is parsed as scripting. This allows you to write script expressions directly without a preceding hash, which can make the code cleaner and reduce the number of hashes needed for complex logic. To embed markup content within scripting mode, you would typically use content blocks `[]`.\n\n**Example using Markup Mode:**\n```typ\n#let markup-template(body) = [\n  #show heading.where(level: 1): underline\n  #set text(font: \"serif\")\n  #body\n]\n```\n\n**Example using Scripting Mode:**\n```typ\n#let script-template(body) = {\n  show heading.where(level: 1): underline\n  set text(font: \"serif\")\n  body // body is a content block, so it doesn't need # here\n}\n```\nBoth achieve the same functional outcome for this simple case, but scripting mode is generally preferred for defining functions as it aligns better with programmatic logic.",

You would include this content block within the template's output simply by placing the argument variable (which holds the content block) in the desired position within the template's body.\n\nHere's an example of a template `document-layout.typ` that takes an optional `header-content` argument:\n```typ\n// document-layout.typ\n#let document-layout(body, header-content: none) = {\n  set page(margin: 1in)\n  set text(font: \"New Computer Modern\")\n\n  // Include the header content if provided\n  if header-content != none {\n    align(center, header-content)\n    line(length: 100%)\n    v(1em)\n  }\n\n  body\n}\n```\nAnd how you would use it in `main.typ`, passing a custom header:\n```typ\n// main.typ\n#import \"document-layout.typ\": document-layout\n\n#show: document-layout.with(header-content: [\n  #text(2em, \"My Awesome Document\") \\\\\n  #text(0.8em, upper(\"Confidential - For Internal Use\"))\n])\n\n= Introduction\nThis is the main body of the document.\nIt follows the custom header.\n\n#lorem(30)\n```\nThis demonstrates how content blocks passed as arguments can be dynamically inserted into the template's structure.",

It's often used when you want to explicitly present a block of code as a distinct listing, perhaps for a code example in a tutorial, a manual, or a report where the code itself is the subject of discussion.\n\nIn essence, `codly` *enhances the visual presentation of general code blocks*, while `codelst` provides a *dedicated content block for explicit source code listings*.",

    "instruction": "The Typst documentation provides a complex `cetz` example for an 'APPLICATION' diagram, resembling a graph or bipartite graph. Explain the key components and logic used to construct such a diagram with nodes, ellipses, and edges.",
    "answer": "The \"APPLICATION\" example (by LDemetrios) demonstrates building a graph-like structure using `cetz` through a combination of data definitions, loops, and various drawing functions. It's a great illustration of how to programmatically generate diagrams.\n\nHere's a breakdown of its key components and how they contribute to the diagram:\n1.  **Data Definitions**: Node positions and connections are defined upfront in `let` variables (`left`, `right` for coordinates, `edges` for connections). This separates data from presentation.\n    ```typ\n    let left = (a:2, b:1, d:-1, e:-2)\n    let right = (p:2.7, q: 1.8, r: 0.9, s: -.3, t: -1.5, u: -2.4)\n    let edges = \"as,bq,dq,et\".split(\",\")\n    ```\n2.  **Global Styling & Dimensions**: Common properties like `ell-width`, `dot-radius`, `dot-clr`, `dist` (distance between ellipses) are set as variables for easy modification and consistency.\n3.  **Drawing Container Ellipses**: Two large `circle` calls define the background ellipses for the left and right sets of nodes. They use the `radius` parameter with a tuple `(x-radius, y-radius)` to create elongated shapes.\n    ```typ\n    circle((-dist/2, 0), radius:(ell-width ,  ell-height))\n    circle((+dist/2, 0), radius:(ell-width ,  ell-height))\n    ```\n4.  **Node Placement and Labeling (Loops)**: `for` loops iterate through the `left` and `right` data. Inside the loop:\n    *   A small `circle` is drawn at the calculated position `(-dist/2, y)` or `(dist/2, y)` and assigned a `name` corresponding to the node (e.g., \"a\", \"b\"). This makes it an anchor.\n    *   `content(name, ...)` is used to place text labels next to each node, using the node's anchor. `anchor` and `pad` are used for precise positioning and spacing.\n    ```typ\n    for (name, y) in left {\n      circle((-dist/2, y), radius:dot-radius, fill:dot-clr, name:name)\n      content(name, anchor:\"east\", pad(right:.7em, text(fill:dot-clr, name)))\n    }\n    ```\n5.  **Edge Drawing and Marking (Loop)**: Another `for` loop iterates through the `edges` string.\n    *   `edge.at(0)` and `edge.at(1)` extract the source and destination node names from each edge string (e.g., \"a\" and \"s\" from \"as\").\n    *   `line(from, to)` draws a line connecting the two nodes, using their assigned names as coordinates.\n    *   `mark(from, to, symbol: \">\")` adds an arrow to indicate direction.\n    ```typ\n    for edge in edges {\n      let from = edge.at(0)\n      let to = edge.at(1)\n      line(from, to)\n      mark(from, to, symbol: \">\",  fill: black)\n    }\n    ```\n6.  **Overall Label**: A final `content` call places the \"APPLICATION\" text at the bottom center of the diagram.\n\nThis example showcases `cetz`'s power for generating complex diagrams from structured data, leveraging its coordinate system, anchors, and looping capabilities. A simplified version might look like this:\n```typ\n// Simplified reproduction of the \"APPLICATION\" example concept\n#import \"@preview/cetz:0.3.4\"\n\n#cetz.canvas({\n  let nodes = (\n    a: (x:-2.5, y:2), b: (x:-2.5, y:0), c: (x:-2.5, y:-2),\n    p: (x:2.5, y:1.5), q: (x:2.5, y:0), r: (x:2.5, y:-1.5)\n  )\n  let connections = \"ap,bq,cq\".split(\",\")\n\n  let dot-radius = 0.15\n  let node-clr = blue\n  let edge-clr = black\n\n  import cetz.draw: *\n  // Draw nodes\n  for (name, pos) in nodes {\n    circle(pos, radius:dot-radius, fill:node-clr, name:name)\n    let anchor-side = if pos.x < 0 {\"east\"} else {\"west\"}\n    let padding = if pos.x < 0 {right:.7em} else {left:.7em}\n    content(name, anchor:anchor-side, pad(padding, text(fill:node-clr, name)))\n  }\n\n  // Draw edges\n  for conn in connections {\n    let from = conn.at(0)\n    let to = conn.at(1)\n    line(from, to, stroke:edge-clr)\n    mark(from, to, symbol: \">\", fill: edge-clr)\n  }\n\n  content((0, -3), text(fill:blue)[Simplified Graph], anchor:\"south\")\n})\n```",

    "instruction": "What are \"anchors\" in `cetz` and how do they facilitate precise positioning of elements?",
    "answer": "Anchors are named reference points automatically created by `cetz` for drawing elements when you assign them a `name`. They allow you to refer to specific points on an element (like its center, corners, midpoints of sides, or start/end points of lines) without needing to calculate their exact coordinates. This enables precise relative positioning.\n\nFor example, if you draw a rectangle named `\"myrect\"`, `cetz` automatically creates anchors like `\"myrect.center\"`, `\"myrect.top-left\"`, `\"myrect.bottom\"`, etc. You can then use these anchor names as coordinates for other drawing functions, ensuring that new elements are perfectly aligned with existing ones.\n```typ\n#import \"@preview/cetz:0.3.4\": canvas, draw\n\n#canvas(length: 1cm, {\n  import draw: *\n  rect((0,0), (2,1), name: \"r\", stroke: red) // A rectangle named 'r'\n  circle(\"r.center\", radius: .1, fill: black) // Circle at the center of 'r'\n  circle(\"r.top-left\", radius: .1, fill: blue) // Circle at the top-left corner of 'r'\n  line(\"r.bottom\", \"r.top\", stroke: green + 1pt) // Draw a line between bottom-center and top-center of 'r'\n  content(\"r.bottom-right\", anchor: \"top-left\", pad(left: .2em, [Bottom Right!])) // Text label\n})\n```",

Pages are numbered globally.\n    *   `header: context { ... }`: Defines the content of the page header. The `context` block allows access to dynamic information like the current page number (`here().page()`).\n        *   `if calc.odd(here().page())`: Checks if the current page number is odd. `here().page()` gets the current page number, and `calc.odd()` checks for oddness.\n        *   `align(right, emph(hydra(1)))`: If the page is odd, the header aligns the content to the right, emphasizes it, and displays the content of the **level 1 heading** (`hydra(1)`) relevant to that page.\n        *   `else { align(left, emph(hydra(2))) }`: If the page is even, the header aligns the content to the left, emphasizes it, and displays the content of the **level 2 heading** (`hydra(2)`) relevant to that page.\n        *   `line(length: 100%)`: Draws a horizontal line across the entire width of the page after the heading text.\n\n*   `#set heading(numbering: \"1.1\")`: This configures the numbering style for headings. A level 1 heading will be `1`, `2`, etc. A level 2 heading under a level 1 heading will be `1.1`, `1.2`, `2.1`, etc. `hydra` automatically picks up this numbering.\n\n*   `#show heading.where(level: 1): it => pagebreak(weak: true) + it`: This is a show rule that applies specifically to level 1 headings.

It also takes up space in the layout if the content is not positioned `outwards`.\n\n*   `#absolute-place` positions content *absolutely on the page*, regardless of the surrounding document flow or margins. Its `dx` and `dy` parameters refer to page coordinates, typically from the top-left corner of the content area.

    "instruction": "Using `strfmt`, how would you right-align a negative integer `test: -74` with a width of 8, padding with `_`, displaying its sign, and converting it to lowercase hexadecimal with a prefix?",
    "answer": "You can combine multiple format specifiers: `-` for sign (implicitly handled by negative), `<` for left-alignment, `#` for the prefix, `8` for width, and `x` for lowercase hexadecimal. However, the example uses `:-<#8x`, which is odd for right-alignment, let's stick to `test:+012e` from the example and adapt.\n\nLooking at the provided example, `:-<#8x` uses left alignment `<` with fill `-`. If you want right alignment, you would use `>`. Let's use the exact example provided for correctness.\n\n```typ\n#import \"@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1\": strfmt\n#strfmt(\"{0:?}, {test:+012e}, {1:-<#8x}\", \"hi\", -74, test: 569.4)\n```\n\nThe example shows `:-<#8x` applies to `-74`. It means: `-` (fill character, although usually applied before align), `<` (left align), `#` (prefix), `8` (width), `x` (hexadecimal lowercase). So `-74` becomes `0x-4a` which is left-padded with `_` to width 8, so `0x-4a____` if it were `_<-#8x`. Given the `:-<#8x` in the example, it seems to imply a fill character that is also a sign character. Let's provide the exact example snippet which implicitly answers the question for this specific combination.\n\nFor a general right-alignment with fill and prefix, you'd do: `#strfmt(\"{0:_>#8x}\", -74)` which would output `___-0x4a` (or `0x-4a` if `x` handles sign directly). But the provided example uses `-` as fill before `<`. So the original example is the best reference.\n\n**Refined Answer:**\nThe provided example demonstrates combining sign, fill, alignment, width, and base conversion. For `-74` formatted with `:-<#8x`, it applies a fill character `_` (implicitly, if the `_` were specified), left-alignment `<`, prefix `#`, width `8`, and converts to lowercase hexadecimal `x`. The `-` symbol acts as a fill character here.\n\n```typ\n#import \"@preview/oxifmt:0.2.1\": strfmt\n#strfmt(\"{0:?}, {test:+012e}, {1:-<#8x}\", \"hi\", -74, test: 569.4)\n```",

For example, `#lower(\"SCREAM\")` takes a string as its single positional argument.\n\n2.  **Named Arguments:** These are specified by their name, followed by a colon `:`, then the value. They increase legibility and can be provided in any order. This is similar to optional arguments in LaTeX often passed in square brackets, e.g., `\\begin{enumerate}[label={\\alph*)}]`.\n\n3.  **Content Arguments:** Many functions accept 'content' as an argument, which is essentially markup that the function will process. Content is enclosed in square brackets `[]`.

This is comparable to LaTeX commands that take an argument in curly braces.\n\n2.  **`set` Rule (declaration-style):** A `set` rule (e.g., `#set text(weight: \"bold\")`) changes the default arguments for a function for all subsequent content within the current scope (or the entire document if not in a specific block). This is analogous to LaTeX declarations like `\\bfseries`.\n\n3.  **`show` Rule (redefinition/transformation):** A `show` rule fundamentally redefines how certain elements are displayed.

These margins will alternate based on whether the page is odd or even and the binding side. By default, Typst assumes left-to-right scripts bind on the left.\n\nHere's an example to set alternating margins:\ntyp```\n#set page(margin: (inside: 2.5cm, outside: 2cm, y: 1.75cm))\n\n#lorem(200)\n#pagebreak()\n#lorem(200)\n```\nOn odd pages (usually right pages in LTR), `inside` will be the left margin and `outside` the right.

Its pixel raster format means the text is just a collection of pixels, not actual text characters. In such cases, **PDF** or **HTML** would be much better choices.\n2.  **Scalability Without Quality Loss is Crucial:** PNGs are raster images, meaning they become pixelated when scaled up beyond their native resolution. If your document needs to be displayed or printed at various sizes without any loss of quality (e.g., for vector graphics, diagrams, or text that might be zoomed in extensively), **PDF** (which supports vector content) is generally preferred.\n3.  **Interactive Elements or Hyperlinks are Needed:** PNGs are static images and do not support interactive features like hyperlinks, embedded fonts, or document outlines.

It's a measure of the spatial resolution of the image.\n\n**How it affects quality:**\n\n*   **Higher PPI:** Means more pixels are packed into each inch of the image. This results in a more detailed, sharper image that appears smoother and less pixelated, especially when viewed up close or on high-resolution screens. However, higher PPI also leads to larger file sizes.\n*   **Lower PPI:** Means fewer pixels per inch, resulting in a less detailed image. When viewed on devices with finer resolutions than the PNG's PPI, the pixels will become noticeable, leading to a perceived loss of quality (pixelation). Lower PPI typically results in smaller file sizes.\n\nTypst calculates the total resolution of your PNG based on each page's physical dimensions and the specified PPI.

    "answer": "Typst's `page` settings (like `fill`) apply within the document and affect how each page is rendered internally. The `--ppi` argument, however, is a *global* export setting that applies to all pages being compiled in a single command. Therefore, you cannot achieve different PPIs for different pages within a single `typ compile` command.\n\nTo achieve different background transparencies per page and different PPIs per page, you would need to:\n\n1.  **Manage Background Transparency within Typst:** Use `#set page(fill: none)` or `#set page(fill: white)` strategically in your document before the relevant pages to control their background.\n2.  **Separate Compile Commands for Different PPIs:** Run `typ compile` multiple times, each time targeting the specific page(s) with the desired `--ppi` and output filename.\n\n**Conceptual Approach (Command Line):**\n\nLet's assume `my_document.typ` contains:\n\ntyp```typ\n#set page(fill: none)\nPage 1 Content (transparent background)\n\n#pagebreak()\nPage 2 Content (default opaque white background)\n```\n\nTo export Page 1 at 300 PPI and Page 2 at 144 PPI:\n\n*   **Export Page 1 (transparent, 300 PPI):**\n    The `page(fill: none)` setting will apply to Page 1.\n    \ntyp```bash\ntyp compile my_document.typ 'output-page-01.png' --pages 1 --ppi 300\n```\n\n*   **Export Page 2 (opaque, 144 PPI):**\n    The default opaque white background will apply to Page 2 (as `fill: none` was not set specifically for it after the page break). The default `--ppi` is 144, but we can explicitly set it for clarity.\n    \ntyp```bash\ntyp compile my_document.typ 'output-page-02.png' --pages 2 --ppi 144\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that each page is rendered at its intended PPI and with its configured background, even though it requires multiple compilation steps.",

    "answer": "This behavior arises because of Typst's evaluation order and how context is established. When a `show` rule or template wraps content, the outer context block for that content might already have been established, and its expressions computed, *before* the `set` rule within the template is actually applied. The `text.lang` within the outer context block is resolved based on the styles known at the outer context's creation.\n\nHowever, a *nested* context block begins its evaluation *after* the `set` rule from the template has been applied. Its evaluation is deferred until its precise styles are known, allowing it to correctly pick up the language change.\n\n```typ\n#let template(body) = {\n  set text(lang: \"fr\")\n  upper(body)\n}\n\n#set text(lang: \"de\")\n#context [\n  #show: template // This template applies `set text(lang: \"fr\")`\n  #text.lang \\ // Still 'de' as outer context was established before template's set rule.\n  #context text.lang // 'fr' as inner context block evaluates after template's set rule.\n]\n```\n\nThis illustrates the importance of carefully choosing the insertion point for a context block to ensure it accesses the desired styles.",

    "answer": "The Typst compiler processes documents multiple times to resolve 'contextual interactions.' This is necessary because information like an element's final position (`locate`), counter values, or state values often depends on the document's layout, which itself depends on these values. Typst first makes a best guess or uses placeholders, lays out the document, and then recompiles with the newly determined information. This iterative process allows values to converge.\n\nIf Typst cannot resolve everything within five attempts (iterations), it will stop and output the warning: `layout did not converge within 5 attempts.` This often indicates a complex circular dependency or misuse of contextual functions that prevents the layout from stabilizing.",

For example, a `show` rule for headings will have context for the current heading number.\n2.  **Numberings in the Outline:** When Typst generates an outline or table of contents, it provides the proper context to resolve counters for headings or figures, ensuring they display the correct numbers based on their position in the document.\n\nWhile these implicitly provide context, for more explicit control or for general expressions that need location awareness, the `{context}` keyword is used.",

The `location` identified by `<intro>` (or any label) might shift between iterations if the document layout changes. If `counter.at()` could be called directly at the top level of a module, the module's exports could become unstable, changing across compiler passes, which is undesirable.

    "instruction": "Imagine you are creating a document with different sections where each section needs a unique background color. Would you primarily use `set rules` or `show rules` for this, and why? Provide a conceptual approach.",
    "answer": "For applying unique background colors to different sections, you would primarily use **`set rules`** within content blocks. While `show rules` *could* be used for complex redefinition, `set rules` are more straightforward for configuring basic properties like background color, especially when confined by scope.\n\n**Why `set rules`?**\n*   **Simplicity**: Setting a background color is a direct property change, which `set rules` are designed for.\n*   **Scoping**: `set rules` naturally support scoping their effect to a content block. You can simply wrap each section in a block and apply a `set rule` for `page` or a custom container within that block.\n\n**Conceptual Approach:**\ntyp```typ\n#set page(fill: luma(250)) // Default background for the whole document\n\n#block(\n  width: 100%,\n  fill: luma(230),\n  padding: 1em,\n  // Set rule for this section's background\n  #set page(fill: rgb(240, 255, 240)) // Light green for Section 1\n  = Section 1: Introduction\n  This is the content for section one. It has a light green background.\n)\n\n#block(\n  width: 100%,\n  fill: luma(230),\n  padding: 1em,\n  // Set rule for this section's background\n  #set page(fill: rgb(255, 240, 240)) // Light red for Section 2\n  = Section 2: Details\n  This is the content for section two. It has a light red background.\n)\n\nThis content goes back to the default background.\n```\nWhile the `set page` inside the block works, for a true section background that *doesn't* change the entire page, you'd likely define a custom `block` or `box` element and set its fill, which is also a `set` operation on that element type.",

    "answer": "Typst uses paths as strings to reference external resources like images or other Typst files. There are two main types:\n\n-   **Relative path**: Searches from the location of the Typst file where the feature is invoked. This is the default.\n    Example: `image(\"images/logo.png\")`\n\n-   **Absolute path**: Searches from the *root* of the project. It starts with a leading `/`.\n    Example: `image(\"/assets/logo.png\")`\n\n**Project Root**: By default, the project root is the parent directory of the main Typst file. For security, files outside this root cannot be read. You can manually set the project root using the CLI's `--root` flag (e.g., `typst compile --root .. file.typ`). In the web app, the entire project is the root.\n\n**Paths and Packages**: A package can only load files from its own directory. Within a package, absolute paths point to the *package root*, not the *project root*. This means a package cannot directly load files from the project directory. If a package needs project resources, they must be passed as already loaded content (e.g., `logo: image(\"mylogo.svg\")`).\n\nExample showing path usage:\n\ntyp```\n// Assuming the following structure:\n// project-root/\n// \u251c\u2500\u2500 main.typ\n// \u251c\u2500\u2500 images/\n// \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 logo.png\n// \u2514\u2500\u2500 assets/\n//     \u2514\u2500\u2500 header.typ\n\n// Relative path: searches from main.typ's directory\n#image(\"images/logo.png\")\n\n// Absolute path: searches from the project root\n#include \"/assets/header.typ\"\n\n#[\n  This document includes an image and a header file from different relative and absolute paths.\n  The image path `images/logo.png` is relative to `main.typ`.\n  The header path `/assets/header.typ` is absolute, pointing from the project root.\n]\n\n// Placeholder for an image, for demonstration purposes. \n// In a real scenario, this would load an actual image file.\n#image(\"../image.png\", width: 50pt)\n```",

    "answer": "Let's break down this `show` rule:\n\n*   `#show \"ArtosFlow\"`: This is the start of the show rule. It specifies that whenever the literal string \"ArtosFlow\" appears in the document, it should be displayed differently.\n*   `: name => ...`: This defines an anonymous function that will be called for each instance of \"ArtosFlow\". The `name` parameter in this function receives the content that is being 'shown' (in this case, the string \"ArtosFlow\"). The `=>` arrow separates the parameters from the function body.\n*   `box[...]`: This is the outermost `box` function. Its purpose is to group the logo image and the text (`#name`) together, preventing a line break from occurring between them. It ensures they stay on the same line as a single block.\n*   `#box(image(\"logo.svg\", height: 0.7em))`: This is an inner `box` containing the `image` function call. The `image` function inserts the specified logo. The `height: 0.7em` sets its height relative to the current font size. The inner `box` around the image prevents the image itself from forming its own paragraph, ensuring it's treated as an inline element next to the text.\n*   `#name`: This inserts the original string \"ArtosFlow\" (which was passed as the `name` argument to the function) into the content block.\n\nIn essence, this rule replaces every instance of \"ArtosFlow\" with its associated logo followed by the text \"ArtosFlow\", ensuring they appear together on the same line, styled as an inline block.\n\nExample usage (assuming `logo.svg` is available as `../image.png` for this example):\ntyp```\n#show \"ArtosFlow\": name => box[\n  #box(image(\n    \"../image.png\",\n    height: 0.7em,\n  ))\n  #name\n]\n\nThis report is embedded in the\nArtosFlow project.

One `em` (`1em`) is equivalent to the current font size.\n\nIts significance lies in the fact that values specified in `em` units will automatically scale if the font size changes. For instance, if you set `leading: 0.52em` and your font size is `10pt`, the leading will be `0.52 * 10pt = 5.2pt`. If you later change the font size to `12pt`, the leading will automatically adjust to `0.52 * 12pt = 6.24pt` without needing to change the leading value itself.\n\nThis makes `em` units ideal for spacing and sizing elements that should maintain a proportional relationship with the text, ensuring a consistent visual rhythm throughout the document regardless of font size changes.",

    "answer": "A `show` rule in Typst allows you to intercept and transform specific elements before they are rendered. It's defined using `show selector: rule_function`. The `selector` specifies which elements the rule applies to (e.g., `heading`, `text`), and the `rule_function` is a content block or function that receives the matched element as a parameter (conventionally named `it`). You can then use `it` to access properties of the element (like `it.body` for text content or `it.level` for heading level) and return new content to replace or wrap the original element.\n\ntyp```\n// Example: Make all strong text red\n#show strong: it => text(fill: red, it)\n\n*This text will be red.*\nThis text will be normal.\n```",

    "instruction": "What is the difference between using `set` rules and `show` rules for styling in Typst?",
    "answer": "`set` rules apply direct property changes to elements. They typically define default styles for content that follows them in the document, and their effect can be scoped within content blocks. For example, `set text(font: \"Arial\")` changes the font for subsequent text.\n\n`show` rules, on the other hand, are more powerful transformations. They intercept an element (like a heading, a list item, or an image) and allow you to completely redefine how it is rendered. You can wrap it in other elements, modify its properties, or even replace it with something entirely different. They are defined for specific element types and can be filtered using `where` selectors.\n\nThink of `set` as applying a coat of paint, while `show` is like rebuilding the entire structure of the element before painting it.\n\ntyp```\n// Set rule: Affects direct properties\n#set text(fill: blue)\nBlue text.\n\n// Show rule: Transforms the element itself\n#show box: it => [Wrapped (#it)]\n#box[Hello]\n```",
