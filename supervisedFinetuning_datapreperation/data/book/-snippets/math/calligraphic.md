# Calligraphic letters

```typ
#let scr(it) = math.class("normal", box({
  show math.equation: set text(stylistic-set: 1)
  $cal(it)$
}))


$ scr(A) scr(B) + scr(C), -scr(D) $
```

Unfortunately, currently just `stylistic-set` for math creates bad spacing. Math engine detects if the letter should be correctly spaced by whether it is the default font. However, just making it "normal" isn't enough, because than it can be reduced. That's way the snippet is as hacky as it is (probably should be located in Typstonomicon, but it's not large enough).
