    "answer": "The primary Typst element for controlling page setup is the `{page}` element. Its set rule, `#set page(...)`, ensures that a new, conforming empty page is inserted afterward, potentially causing a page break. Therefore, it is best practice to specify your `{page}` set rule at the very beginning of your document or within your template file to avoid unexpected page breaks later on.\n\nHere's a basic example showing some page settings:\ntyp```\n#set rect(\n  width: 100%,\n  height: 100%,\n  inset: 4pt,\n)\n#set text(6pt)\n#set page(margin: auto)\n\n#set page(\n  paper: \"iso-b7\",\n  header: rect(fill: aqua)[Header],\n  footer: rect(fill: aqua)[Footer],\n  number-align: center,\n)\n\n#rect(fill: aqua.lighten(40%))\n```",

Instead, its computation is deferred until it is actually placed somewhere in the document, at which point its specific context (like styling or location) becomes known. You cannot directly 'peek into' or inspect the value of opaque content in your Typst code because its value is dynamic and depends on its environment.\n\nWhen stored in a variable and used multiple times, the opaque content correctly reacts to the different environments it's placed into, resolving dynamically for each instance.\n\ntyp```\n#let value = context text.lang\n\n#set text(lang: \"en\")\n#value // Resolves to 'en'\n\n#set text(lang: \"de\")\n#value // Resolves to 'de'\n\n#set text(lang: \"fr\")\n#value // Resolves to 'fr'\n```\n\nIn this example, the `value` variable holds an opaque context expression.

    "answer": "Context blocks can be nested, and contextual code will always access the *innermost* context that encloses it. The key is that the evaluation of a context block is deferred until the styles for it are known.\n\nAn outer context block might not reflect changes from an inner `set` rule if the outer context expression was effectively 'closed' or its evaluation started *before* the inner `set` rule was applied. In contrast, a nested context block, being defined *after* the inner `set` rule, will correctly capture those styles.\n\nThis is because `set` rules apply to content *after* it has been constructed and potentially already contextualized. If an outer context expression has already determined its styles, a later `set` rule applied to its *body* won't change its own resolved style, but it *will* affect any *new* context expressions created within that body.\n\ntyp```\n#set text(lang: \"de\")\n#context [\n  // This text.lang is part of the outer context's evaluation.\n  // It's effectively 'closed' before the inner set rule takes effect for its own value.\n  Outer context lang: #text.lang \\ \n  \n  #set text(lang: \"fr\")\n  \n  // This context block is defined *after* set text(lang: \"fr\"),\n  // so it correctly captures the new language.\n  Inner context lang: #context text.lang\n]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Outer context lang` will show `de` because its context resolved *before* `set text(lang: \"fr\")` applied to its content. However, the `Inner context lang` (which is a new, nested `context` block) will show `fr` because it's evaluated after that `set` rule has taken effect for its containing scope.",

    "instruction": "Why does the Typst compiler process documents multiple times to resolve contextual interactions, and what warning might appear if this process fails?",
    "answer": "The Typst compiler processes documents multiple times (in iterations) to resolve contextual interactions because some values, like positions (`locate`) or counter states, depend on the final layout of the document. Initially, these values might only be placeholders. Typst performs a layout pass, determines the actual positions and counter states, and then recompiles the document with this newly acquired information.\n\nThis iterative process allows features like cross-references, tables of contents, and dynamic headers to function correctly. Typst uses a convergence mechanism, meaning it re-evaluates until all contextual values stabilize.\n\nIf Typst cannot resolve all contextual interactions within a certain number of attempts (typically five), it will stop and output a warning indicating a failure to converge. The warning message is:\n\n`layout did not converge within 5 attempts.`\n\nThis usually suggests a cyclical dependency or a misuse of contextual functions (e.g., certain state manipulations) that prevents the document from reaching a stable layout.",

    "answer": "You can define your own contextual function by wrapping its body in a `{context}` block if it needs to access contextual information. Functions like `1em.to-absolute()` are inherently contextual because 'absolute' depends on the current text size, which is a contextual property.\n\nHere's an example of a custom function `foo()` that becomes contextual because it tries to convert `1em` to an absolute length, which depends on the `text.size` in its environment:\n\ntyp```\n#let foo() = 1em.to-absolute()\n\n// Outside context, this might not work or behave predictably if size isn't known.\n// However, when called inside a context block, it works as expected.\n#context {\n  // foo() will evaluate its 1em based on the text.size at this specific context.\n  \"Is 1em equal to current text size? \" + str(foo() == text.size)\n}\n\n#set text(size: 20pt)\n#context {\n  \"Is 1em equal to current text size? \" + str(foo() == text.size)\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `foo()` will resolve `1em` to an absolute length based on the `text.size` active within the `context` block where `foo()` is called. This demonstrates that `foo()` itself becomes a contextual function, even if it doesn't explicitly contain a `context` keyword in its definition, because it uses functions that *are* contextual (`to-absolute()`). The comparison `foo() == text.size` will evaluate to `true` in both `context` blocks.",

    "instruction": "What is the role of 'compiler iterations' in Typst when resolving context, and what does it imply about `counter.at(<label>)` even if it doesn't directly use the current location?",
    "answer": "To resolve contextual interactions (like `locate` calls, counter values, or state), the Typst compiler processes the document in multiple 'compiler iterations'. In the first pass, it might use placeholder values. Then, after laying out the document, it obtains the actual values (e.g., precise positions, final counter states) and re-compiles until all values stabilize.\n\nEven though `counter.at(<label>)` doesn't depend on the *current* location in the way `counter.get()` or `locate(here())` do, it *still* requires a context block. This is because the value it retrieves from the specified label (`<label>`) might itself change over the course of these multiple compiler iterations.\n\nFor example, the section numbered '1.' might become '2.' if a new section is added before it, or its page might change due to layout adjustments. If `counter.at(<label>)` could be called at the top level of a module without context, the value it returns (and thus the module's behavior or exports) could unpredictably change between iterations, which is undesirable for consistent compilation.

    "answer": "Typst's context system ensures that counter values are resolved correctly based on their location, even when they are updated. By using `counter.update()` to change a counter's value and `counter.display()` to show it, you can observe how nested contexts behave.\n\ntyp```\n#let c = counter(\"mycounter\")\n#c.update(1)\n\n#context [\n  #c.update(2) // This updates the counter for content within this context and subsequent content\n  Outer context counter display: #c.display() \\ // Will show (2,) if this context block's content is evaluated after update\n  \n  #context [\n    // This updates the counter for content within *this* nested context\n    #c.update(3)\n    Inner context counter display: #c.display()\n  ]\n  \n  // After the inner context, the outer context's counter value (2) is still in effect for new content here\n  Outer context after inner: #c.display()\n]\n\n// Outside the context blocks, the last update that applied to the document scope will be visible (if any).\n// In this case, the c.update(1) would be the base, and then subsequent ones affect contextual content.\n// Let's explicitly show the state outside to be clear.\nAfter all contexts: #c.display()\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Outer context counter display` will show `(2,)` because it's evaluated after `c.update(2)`. The `Inner context counter display` will show `(3,)` because it's within a nested context block where `c.update(3)` applies. When the outer context continues after the inner one (`Outer context after inner`), it will revert to `(2,)` because the `c.update(3)` only applied within the *nested* context block. The final `After all contexts` will show `(1,)` or `(2,)` depending on how the updates propagate (usually, `update` within context applies to the content within that specific context, not globally).\n\n*Note*: The behavior of `c.update()` within and outside of contexts can sometimes be subtle regarding its global or localized effect. Typically, an `update` within a context applies to the content *inside* that context. The example demonstrates the local effect within the `context` blocks for `display()` calls.",

It effectively pastes the content of the included file at the inclusion point.\n\n    **Example:**\n    (Assume `header.typ` contains: `[#heading(level: 1)[My Document Header]]`)\ntyp```\n#include \"header.typ\"\n\nThis is the main content.\n```\n\n2.  **`import \"path/to/file.typ\"`**: Evaluates the file and inserts the resulting module object into the current scope with the filename (without extension) as its name. You can then access definitions using dot notation.\n\n    **Example:**\n    (Assume `utils.typ` contains: `let PI = 3.14; let area(r) = PI * r * r;`)\ntyp```\n#import \"utils.typ\"\nThe value of PI is #utils.PI.\nThe area of a circle with radius 2 is #utils.area(2).\n```\n\n3.  **`import \"path.typ\" as custom_name`**: Similar to `import`, but allows you to rename the imported module to a custom name.\n\n    **Example:**\ntyp```\n#import \"utils.typ\" as my_tools\nUsing my tools: #my_tools.area(3).\n```\n\n4.  **`import \"path.typ\": item1, item2`**: Evaluates the file and directly extracts specific variables or functions defined within it, making them available in the current scope without needing the module prefix.\n\n    **Example:**\ntyp```\n#import \"utils.typ\": PI, area\nPI is #PI. Area is #area(4).\n```\n\n5.  **`import \"path.typ\": *`**: Imports all variables and functions defined in the specified module directly into the current scope.\n\n    **Example:**\ntyp```\n#import \"utils.typ\": *\nAll symbols from utils are available: PI is #PI. Area is #area(5).\n```\n\nTo make these examples runnable, create a file named `header.typ` and `utils.typ` in the same directory as your main Typst file with the content specified above.\n\n`header.typ`:\ntyp```\n#heading(level: 1)[My Document Header]\n```\n\n`utils.typ`:\ntyp```\n#let PI = 3.14159\n#let area(r) = PI * r * r\n#let greeting = \"Hello from utils!\"\n```",

They apply styling by modifying existing properties.\n-   **Show rules** provide deeper customization by completely redefining the appearance of elements. They are written using the `#show` keyword followed by a selector and then either a set rule, a function, a literal string, or a content block. They can transform, replace, or wrap elements, offering maximum flexibility.\n\nThe key difference is that set rules adjust predefined properties, while show rules can completely transform or replace the element's rendering from scratch.",

When an absolute path is used within a package, it resolves relative to the *package's root*, not the user's overall *project root*. This design prevents a package from potentially accessing arbitrary files on a user's system, enhancing security.\n\nIf a package needs resources from the user's project (like a custom logo, data file, or another Typst file), the user must *load that resource in their main project file* and then pass the *loaded object* (e.g., an `image` element, a `content` block, or a `string` containing data) to the package's functions as a parameter.\n\n**Example:**\nSuppose you have a package `my-template` that includes a `document` function, and you want it to display a user-provided logo.\n\n1.  **User's `main.typ`:** (This file is in the user's project, where `../image.png` is accessible)\n    ```typ\n    #import \"@preview/my-template:0.1.0\" as my-template\n\n    // User loads the image from their project path\n    #let user_company_logo = image(\"../image.png\", width: 50pt)\n\n    #my-template.document(logo: user_company_logo, [\n      This is the content of my document, generated using the template.\n    ])\n    ```\n\n2.  **`my-template/template.typ` (within the package's source code):**\n    ```typ\n    // In my-template/template.typ\n    #let document(logo: none, body) = {\n      set page(margin: 1in)\n      #if logo != none {\n        align(right, logo)\n        v(1em) // Add some vertical space below the logo\n      }\n      body\n    }\n    ```\nIn this scenario, the `image` element is created within the user's project context (where `../image.png` is resolved), and then the resulting image object is passed to the `document` function of the `my-template` package.

This means you can write mathematical expressions directly, but you'll still need the hash syntax (`#`) to pass code expressions (like variables or complex computations), except for strings, which are available in math syntax.\n2.  **Argument Handling**: They support positional arguments, named arguments, and argument spreading (`..#array`).\n3.  **No Trailing Content Blocks**: Unlike some code functions, math calls do not support trailing content blocks.\n4.  **2D Argument Lists**: They provide special syntax for 2-dimensional argument lists, notably using a semicolon (`;`) to merge preceding comma-separated arguments into an array argument, which is particularly useful for matrices.\n5.  **Escaping**: To write a verbatim comma or semicolon within a math call, you must escape it with a backslash (`\\,` or `\\;`). A colon (`:`) is only treated specially if directly preceded by an identifier; otherwise, it's verbatim. If you need a verbatim colon immediately after an identifier, insert a space before it.\n\nNormal code function calls (e.g., `#f(a)`) are not affected by these special rules and behave as typical Typst code functions.\n\nExample illustrating various math calls:\n```typ\n$ frac(a^2, 2) $\n$ vec(1, 2, delim: \"[\") $\n$ mat(1, 2; 3, 4) $\n#let my_data = range(1, 5).chunks(2)\n$ mat(..#my_data) $\n$ lim_x = op(\"lim\", limits: #true)_x $\n```",

This helps maintain consistency and prevents broken references. You use the `#label()` function to mark an element and the `#ref()` function to create a reference to it.\n\nHere are examples for both a section and a figure:\n\ntyp```\n= Document Structure #label(\"sec:doc-structure\")\n\nThis section explains the overall document structure.\n\n#figure(\n  #image(\"../image.png\", width: 70%),\n  caption: \"A diagram showing the document layout.\",\n  label: \"fig:layout-diagram\"\n)\n\nAs discussed in Section @sec:doc-structure, the layout shown in Figure @fig:layout-diagram is crucial for readability.\n```\n\nWhen compiled, `@sec:doc-structure` and `@fig:layout-diagram` will be replaced by their respective numbers (e.g., \"Section 1\" and \"Figure 1\").",

    "answer": "Typst offers integrated support for bibliography management, allowing you to cite sources within your text and generate a bibliography section. This typically involves defining your sources (e.g., in a BibTeX file) and then using specific functions like `#cite()` for in-text citations and `#bibliography()` to output the full list of references.\n\nWhile the exact setup depends on your source file and styles, the general workflow involves:\n1.  **Importing your bibliography data**: Often from a `.bib` file.\n2.  **Citing within the text**: Using a function like `#cite()` with a key corresponding to an entry in your bibliography.\n3.  **Generating the bibliography**: Placing a `#bibliography()` function where you want the list of references to appear.\n\nAlthough the full syntax for `#cite` and `#bibliography` depends on the loaded data and style, their purpose is to manage and display your research sources systematically.\n\ntyp```\n// Example: Assuming a bibliography file 'references.bib' is loaded\n// #set bibliography(\"references.bib\") // (This is how it generally works, but not explicitly in snippet)\n\nThis is a statement requiring a citation @smith2020.\nAnother point of view is presented by @doe2021.\n\n#pagebreak()\n= References\n#bibliography()\n```\n\nThis structure enables automatic generation of citations and a reference list based on your source data.",

This can make your source code easier to understand and write.

Unlike a standard symbol which only represents a glyph, `dif` and `Dif` influence the surrounding layout and presentation. Specifically, they automatically adjust spacing to ensure correct mathematical typesetting conventions (e.g., a thin space before `dx` in an integral) and may apply specific font styles to the variable they modify (e.g., an upright 'd' for the differential).

Since each alignment point alternates between right-aligned and left-aligned, `&&` causes the alignment to alternate twice. This means the column immediately following `&&` will be right-aligned, and the column after that will be left-aligned, unlike a single `&` which would make the first column left-aligned.\n\nThis is particularly useful when you want to align an equation and then add a left-aligned comment next to it, starting a new alignment cycle.\n\nConsider this example:\n\n```typ\n$ (3x + y) / 7 &= 9 && \"given\" \\\\\n  3x + y &= 63 & \"multiply by 7\" \\\\\n  3x &= 63 - y && \"subtract y\" \\\\\n  x &= 21 - y/3 & \"divide by 3\" $\n```\nIn this code:\n- The first line uses `&&` before \"given\". The `(3x + y) / 7` is right-aligned, `= 9` is left-aligned, and \"given\" is also left-aligned because the `&&` effectively 'skipped' a right-aligned column.\n- The second line uses a single `&` before \"multiply by 7\". `3x + y` is right-aligned, `63` is left-aligned, and \"multiply by 7\" is also left-aligned as it's the next column after an alignment point.\n\nIt's important to note that `& &` (two single ampersands with a space) behaves exactly the same way as `&&`.",

The `n-` prefix is applied to `equiv` to form `nequiv`, then combined with `gt`. This implies that the 'not' applies to the 'equivalent' part of the symbol concept.\n*   `gt.tilde.not`: This symbol represents 'greater than' with a tilde, and then the entire composite symbol is negated. The `.not` suffix acts on the `gt.tilde` combination.\n\nEssentially, `n-` is sometimes used for inherent negation within a compound symbol's definition (e.g., `nequiv` is a distinct concept of 'not equivalent'), while `.not` is a general modifier to cross out any symbol or symbol combination.",

    "instruction": "Explain the concept of module visibility in Typst, particularly how it affects multi-file projects. Why is a dedicated `template.typ` file essential for sharing definitions across chapters, and why can't chapters directly see definitions from `main.typ` or from each other?",
    "answer": "In Typst, modules (individual `.typ` files) operate with strict visibility rules: a module can only \"see\" or access what it defines locally within itself or what it explicitly `import`s from another file. Any definition not created within the module or imported is invisible to it.\n\nThis strict module visibility is why a dedicated `template.typ` file is essential for sharing definitions (such as functions, variables, or custom styles) across a multi-file project. Since `main.typ` and individual chapter files are separate, independent modules:\n\n*   **Chapters cannot directly see definitions from `main.typ`**: If you define a variable or function directly within `main.typ` (e.g., `#let my-setting = ...`), it will only be visible within `main.typ` itself. The chapter files included by `main.typ` will not have access to `my-setting` unless `main.typ` passes it explicitly, which is not the standard way for global settings.\n*   **Chapters cannot directly see each other**: Similarly, `chapter_1.typ` cannot directly access content or definitions from `chapter_2.typ`, and vice versa. They are separate compilation units that are only assembled by `main.typ`.\n\nBy placing all shared definitions in `template.typ` and explicitly importing `template.typ` into both `main.typ` and every individual chapter file, you ensure that all parts of your document have consistent and direct access to the necessary global elements, adhering to Typst's module visibility rules.",

    "instruction": "What constitutes a \"cyclic import\" in Typst, and why is it forbidden? Provide a conceptual example of a forbidden cyclic import and suggest how to resolve such a scenario if you need to share variables between files that might otherwise cause a cycle.",
    "answer": "A \"cyclic import\" in Typst occurs when two or more modules (individual `.typ` files) attempt to import each other, either directly or indirectly, forming a closed loop of dependencies. For example, if `chapter_1.typ` imports `chapter_2.typ`, and simultaneously `chapter_2.typ` imports `chapter_1.typ`, this creates a direct cyclic dependency.\n\nTypst forbids cyclic imports because they lead to ambiguities and potential infinite loops during the compilation process. The compiler cannot determine a clear, linear order in which to resolve the definitions and evaluate the modules if they are circularly dependent on each other.\n\n**Example of a Forbidden Cyclic Import:**\n- `chapters/chapter_1.typ` contains: `// ... content ... #import \"chapter_2.typ\": *`\n- `chapters/chapter_2.typ` contains: `// ... content ... #import \"chapter_1.typ\": *`\n\n**How to Resolve Cyclic Imports:**\nIf you find yourself in a situation where two files need to share variables or functions that would otherwise create a cyclic import, the solution is to introduce a *third* file (or utilize your existing `template.typ`). This third file acts as an intermediary, holding the shared definitions. Both of the original files can then import from this third file without creating a cycle.\n\nFor instance, if `chapter_1.typ` and `chapter_2.typ` both require access to a variable named `project-version`:\n\n1.  **Define the shared variable** in your central `template.typ` (or a newly created `shared-vars.typ`):\ntyp```\n// template.typ (or shared-vars.typ)\n#let project-version = \"1.0.0\"\n```\n\n2.  **Import the variable** into both `chapter_1.typ` and `chapter_2.typ`:\ntyp```\n// chapters/chapter_1.typ\n#import \"../template.typ\": project-version\n\n#set text(blue)\n= Chapter One\n\nThis document is version #project-version.\n```\ntyp```\n// chapters/chapter_2.typ\n#import \"../template.typ\": project-version\n\n#set text(red)\n= Chapter Two\n\nThis section also refers to version #project-version.\n```\nThis approach ensures that `chapter_1` and `chapter_2` only depend on `template.typ` (or `shared-vars.typ`), breaking the direct cycle between them and allowing the document to compile successfully.",

    "answer": "`showybox` (from `@preview/showybox`) offers a highly customizable frame structure with distinct sections for title, body, and footer, each with independent color and style options (borders, background, separator lines, shadows). It's ideal for presenting structured content like theorems, definitions, or multi-part notices where visual hierarchy and precise styling are crucial.\n\n`colorbox` (from `@preview/colorful-boxes`) provides a simpler, single-colored box that primarily wraps content. While it allows setting color, radius, and width, it lacks the detailed control over distinct title/footer sections, separators, and shadows that `showybox` offers. It's suitable for simpler highlighted text, short notes, or when you need a basic colored background for content without complex structural elements.\n\n**Use `showybox` when:**\n*   You need a clear title, body, and/or footer section.\n*   You want to apply different background colors or border styles to title, body, and footer areas.\n*   You require custom separator lines, shadows with specific offsets/colors, or complex border patterns.\n*   Presenting academic content (theorems, definitions, examples) that benefits from clear visual segmentation.\n\n**Use `colorbox` when:**\n*   You need a simple, single-color background for a block of text.\n*   You want minimal styling for emphasis (e.g., a colored highlight).\n*   The content doesn't require separate title/footer areas.\n*   You prefer a more minimalistic design for your boxed content.",

This `style` variable can then be reused to apply these properties consistently to different drawing elements.\n\n*   `#let f1(x) = calc.sin(x)` defines a function named `f1` that takes one argument `x` and returns the sine of `x` using Typst's built-in `calc.sin` function. This is the primary function being plotted.\n\n*   `#let fn = (...)` defines a variable named `fn` that holds an array (or tuple) of pairs.

It's used within the `fn` array to compute terms for the Taylor series approximations (e.g., `x^3`, `x^5`, `x^7`).\n*   `calc.pi`: A mathematical constant representing the value of pi (approximately 3.14159). It's used to define the domain of the plot and the step size for x-axis ticks (`x-tick-step: calc.pi/2`), which is essential for accurate and well-labeled trigonometric plots.\n\nThey are used to perform the necessary mathematical operations for defining and plotting the trigonometric functions and their approximations, leveraging Typst's native calculation capabilities.",

    "answer": "Polylux and Slydst offer different philosophies for creating presentations:\n\n*   **Polylux:** Is more feature-rich and powerful, allowing for dynamic content like gradual reveals (`#uncover`, `#only`). It gives you fine-grained control over slide content and transitions. It's suitable for complex presentations requiring advanced effects.\n    *   *Reference:* [polylux book](https://polylux.dev/book/)\n\n*   **Slydst:** Is much simpler and less powerful. It focuses on basic presentation structures, predefined layouts, and straightforward content inclusion (figures, definitions, outlines). It's ideal for quick, minimalist presentations where dynamic features are not required.\n    *   *Reference:* [slydst GitHub](https://github.com/glambrechts/slydst?ysclid=lr2gszrkck541184604)\n\n**When to choose:**\n*   Choose **Polylux** if you need dynamic content, complex layouts, or custom animations on your slides.\n*   Choose **Slydst** if you prefer simplicity, require a quick setup for static slides, and don't need advanced interactive features.",

    "instruction": "Is it possible to define optional positional arguments directly in a Typst function's signature, similar to how some other programming languages allow it with default values for positional parameters?",
    "answer": "Currently, Typst does not directly support defining optional positional arguments with default values in the function signature, like `func(a, b=10)`. The `b=10` syntax would make `b` a key argument. If you need to make positional arguments optional, the primary way to achieve this is by using the `..args` syntax to collect all arbitrary arguments.\n\nYou then need to manually check `args.pos()` for the presence and value of those optional positional arguments and assign defaults if they are missing. For example:\n\n```typ\n#let my-function(required_arg, ..args) = {\n  let optional_arg1 = args.pos().at(0, default: \"default_value_1\") // Get first positional arg or default\n  let optional_arg2 = args.pos().at(1, default: \"default_value_2\") // Get second positional arg or default\n\n  [\n    Required: #required_arg\n    Optional 1: #optional_arg1\n    Optional 2: #optional_arg2\n  ]\n}\n\n#set text(font: \"Source Code Pro\")\n#my-function(\"A\")\n#my-function(\"B\", \"custom_value_1\")\n#my-function(\"C\", \"custom_value_1\", \"custom_value_2\")\n```\n\nThis approach gives you control over handling optional positional arguments, but it requires more manual unpacking and default assignment compared to direct signature support.",

The file root (top-level document) is considered the outermost scope, and anything defined there is generally accessible everywhere, unless shadowed by a more local definition.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating variable scope:\ntyp```\n#{\n  // 'a' is defined within this code block's scope\n  let a = \"Hello\";\n  a\n}\n\n// Error: 'a' is not defined in this scope\n// #a \n\n#let b = \"World\"; // 'b' is defined in the file root scope\n#b\n```\nIf you uncomment `#a` outside its scope, Typst will raise an error.",

    "instruction": "How do `set` and `show` rules interact with Typst's scoping rules? Provide an example.",
    "answer": "`set` and `show` rules in Typst are also affected by scoping. They apply only to the content within the scope where they are defined. Once the scope ends, their effect ceases.\n\nExample:\ntyp```\n#[ // This square bracket block creates a new content scope\n  #set text(fill: blue)\n  #show \"true\": \"_false_\"\n\n  This text is blue.\n  This is true.\n]\n\n// Outside the block, the blue color and show rule no longer apply\nThis text is default color.\nThis is true.\n```\nAs you can see, the `set text` and `show` rules only applied within the `#[...]` block.",

    "instruction": "Describe the default return behavior of braces `{}` in Typst functions, and how can you prevent this behavior if you don't want anything returned implicitly?",
    "answer": "By default, braces `{}` in Typst implicitly return anything that \"returns\" into them. This means that if an expression within the brace block produces a value, that value will be the effective return of the block, and if multiple expressions produce values, they might be joined together.\n\nExample of implicit return:\ntyp```\n#let generate_message() = {\n  \"Step 1: Initializing...\"\n  // A value produced here\n  str(12345)\n  \"Step 2: Done!\"\n}\n\n#generate_message() // Will output: \"Step 1: Initializing...12345Step 2: Done!\"\n```\n\nTo prevent this behavior and ensure nothing is returned or only a specific value is returned, you can explicitly use `return none` or `return <value>`.\n\nExample using `return none`:\ntyp```\n#let do_something_silent() = {\n  // This code might produce values, but we don't want them returned\n  \"A temporary message\"\n  1 + 2\n  return none // Explicitly returns nothing\n  \"This will not be returned\"\n}\n\n// This call will not output anything to the document\n#do_something_silent()\n```",

    "instruction": "How do you define default values for function parameters in Typst, and what is the consequence of doing so regarding argument naming?",
    "answer": "You define default values for function parameters in Typst using the syntax `parameter_name: default_value`. This allows you to call a function without explicitly providing a value for that parameter, in which case the default will be used.\n\nA key consequence of defining a default value for an argument is that the argument automatically becomes a **named argument**. This means that when you call the function, you must refer to this parameter by its name (e.g., `func(param_name: value)`) rather than just its position.\n\nExample:\ntyp```\n#let greet(name: \"Guest\", salutation: \"Hello\") = {\n  [#salutation, #name!]\n}\n\n#greet() // Uses both default values: \"Hello, Guest!\"\n#greet(name: \"Alice\") // Overrides 'name': \"Hello, Alice!\"\n#greet(salutation: \"Hi there\") // Overrides 'salutation': \"Hi there, Guest!\"\n#greet(name: \"Bob\", salutation: \"Greetings\") // Overrides both: \"Greetings, Bob!\"\n```",

    "instruction": "Explain how to explicitly return `none` from a Typst function and provide a scenario where this would be useful.",
    "answer": "To explicitly return `none` from a Typst function, you simply use the statement `return none;` inside the function's code block. This prevents any implicit return values (like the last expression's result) from being propagated out of the function.\n\n**Scenario where this is useful:**\nConsider a function that performs some side effects, like setting global document properties or performing logging, but doesn't intend to output any content to the document flow. If such a function implicitly returned something (e.g., a string message, a number from a calculation), that value would unexpectedly appear in your document. By returning `none`, you ensure the function only performs its intended side effect without affecting the document layout.\n\nExample:\ntyp```\n#let configure_document_metadata() = {\n  // This function modifies document settings, not document content\n  set document(title: \"My Report\", author: \"AI Assistant\")\n  // A print statement might implicitly return a string in some contexts\n  print(\"Document metadata configured.\") \n  \n  return none // Ensure nothing is printed to the document itself\n}\n\n// Calling this function will set metadata but won't print \"Document metadata configured.\" into the document.\n#configure_document_metadata()\n\nHello World!\n```",
