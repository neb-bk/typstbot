= Pythagorean Theorem and Quadratic Formula

In Euclidean geometry, the Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This can be expressed as $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

Furthermore, for a quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a != 0$, the values of $x$ are given by the quadratic formula. Let's make this equation blue.

$ x = (-b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a) $

Beyond basic algebra, the gradient operator, denoted by #math.nabla, is a fundamental concept in vector calculus, representing the multivariable generalization of the derivative.
