# Markup language
## Starting
```typ
Starting typing in Typst is easy.
You don't need packages or other weird things for most of things.

Blank line will move text to a new paragraph.

Btw, you can use any language and unicode symbols
without any problems as long as the font supports it: √ü√ß≈ìÃÉ…õÃÉ√∏‚àÄŒ±Œ≤—ë—ã·ÉêüòÜ‚Ä¶
```

## Markup
```typ
= Markup

This was a heading. Number of `=` in front of name corresponds to heading level.

== Second-level heading

Okay, let's move to _emphasis_ and *bold* text.

Markup syntax is generally similar to
`AsciiDoc` (this was `raw` for monospace text!)
```

## New lines & Escaping
```typ
You can break \
line anywhere you \
want using "\\" symbol.

Also you can use that symbol to
escape \_all the symbols you want\_,
if you don't want it to be interpreted as markup
or other special symbols.
```

## Comments & codeblocks
```````typ
You can write comments with `//` and `/* comment */`:
// Like this
/* Or even like
this */

```typ
Just in case you didn't read source,
this is how it is written:

// Like this
/* Or even like
this */

By the way, I'm writing it all in a _fenced code block_ with *syntax highlighting*!
```
```````

## Smart quotes

```typ
== What else?

There are not much things in basic "markup" syntax,
but we will see much more interesting things very soon!
I hope you noticed auto-matched "smart quotes" there.
```

## Lists
```typ
- Writing lists in a simple way is great.
- Nothing complex, start your points with `-`
  and this will become a list.
  - Indented lists are created via indentation.

+ Numbered lists start with `+` instead of `-`.
+ There is no alternative markup syntax for lists
+ So just remember `-` and `+`, all other symbols
  wouldn't work in an unintended way.
  + That is a general property of Typst's markup.
  + Unlike Markdown, there is only one way
    to write something with it.
```

**Notice:**
```typ
Typst numbered lists differ from markdown-like syntax for lists. If you write them by hand, numbering is preserved:

1. Apple
1. Orange
1. Peach
```

## Math
```typ

I will just mention math ($a + b/c = sum_i x^i$)
is possible and quite pretty there:

$
7.32 beta +
  sum_(i=0)^nabla
    (Q_i (a_i - epsilon)) / 2
$
