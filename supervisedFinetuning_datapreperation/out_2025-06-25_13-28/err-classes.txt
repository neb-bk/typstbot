  {
    "instruction": "What is the primary purpose of 'classes' for math symbols in Typst?",
    "answer": "In Typst, each math symbol has an assigned 'class' that determines how it behaves and, consequently, how it is layouted. This includes aspects like spacing around the symbol, its vertical alignment, and how it interacts with other symbols or delimiters."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How can you explicitly set or override the class of a specific math symbol within an equation in Typst?",
    "answer": "You can use the `class()` function to explicitly assign a class to a symbol. The function takes two arguments: the class name as a string and the symbol itself.\n\ntyp```typ\n$a class(\"punctuation\", b) c$\n```\n\nThis example changes the symbol `b` to behave like punctuation, affecting the spacing around it."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Demonstrate how the 'normal', 'punctuation', and 'opening' classes affect the layout of a symbol 'b' when applied using the `class()` function.",
    "answer": "The layout differences primarily manifest as changes in spacing around the symbol and sometimes vertical alignment.\n\n- **Normal Class**: Symbols with the 'normal' class typically have no special spacing around them, behaving like regular variables.\ntyp```typ\n$a class(\"normal\", b) c$\n```\n\n- **Punctuation Class**: Symbols acting as 'punctuation' (like commas or semicolons) usually have tight spacing on their left and potentially some space on their right.\ntyp```typ\n$a class(\"punctuation\", b) c$\n```\n\n- **Opening Class**: Symbols like opening parentheses `(` or brackets `[` are of the 'opening' class. They have space on their right and tight spacing on their left. When used within `lr()` (left-right) delimiters, they might also adjust their vertical position.\ntyp```typ\n$a class(\"opening\", b) c$\n```"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How can you globally change the default math class for all occurrences of a specific symbol, for instance, making the `circle` symbol behave like a 'normal' variable instead of its default?",
    "answer": "You can achieve this using a `#show` rule with `math.class.with()`. This rule specifies that whenever the `math.circle` symbol is encountered, it should be rendered with the 'normal' math class.\n\ntyp```typ\n#show math.circle: math.class.with(\"normal\")\n$square circle square$\n```\n\nThis will remove the default spacing that `circle` might have, making it behave like a simple variable without extra spacing."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Explain the difference in effect between using `#h(0pt)` and `math.class.with(\"normal\")` to reduce spacing around a symbol like `circle` in math mode. Provide Typst code examples for both.",
    "answer": "While both can reduce spacing, they operate on different principles:\n\n1.  **`#h(0pt)` (Explicit Horizontal Skip)**:\n    This command inserts a fixed, zero-point horizontal space. It's a direct layout instruction that overrides any automatic spacing. It's effective but can be less semantic and might not adapt as well in different contexts (e.g., if Typst's spacing rules change).\n    \ntyp```typ\n$square #h(0pt) circle #h(0pt) square$\n```\n\n2.  **`math.class.with(\"normal\")` (Semantic Class Change)**:\n    This changes the *semantic* class of the symbol. By setting it to 'normal', you instruct Typst to treat `circle` as a standard variable, which inherently has no special spacing around it. This approach is more robust as it leverages Typst's built-in spacing rules for that class, which can automatically adjust to different math modes (e.g., inline vs. display).\n    \ntyp```typ\n#show math.circle: math.class.with(\"normal\")\n$square circle square$\n```\n\nIn essence, `#h(0pt)` is a manual patch, while `math.class.with(\"normal\")` is a semantic change that tells Typst how to *categorize* and thus *automatically space* the symbol."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "How does applying the 'opening' class to a symbol within `lr()` delimiters affect its vertical alignment in Typst math mode?",
    "answer": "When a symbol is explicitly assigned the 'opening' class using `class()` and then used within `lr()` delimiters, it can cause a vertical shift compared to its default behavior. This happens because Typst's `lr()` function expects its contents to conform to the standard behavior of 'opening' and 'closing' delimiters to correctly align them.\n\nConsider this example:\n\ntyp```typ\n$a lr(b c]) c\na lr(class(\"opening\", b) c ]) c$\n```\n\nIn the second line, where `b` is explicitly set to `class(\"opening\", b)`, you will notice that the `b` symbol is moved vertically. This demonstrates how overriding the class influences not just horizontal spacing but also vertical positioning within flexible delimiters like `lr()`."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "List and briefly describe some of the different math symbol classes available in Typst as per the documentation, mentioning their general layout characteristics.",
    "answer": "Typst provides several math symbol classes, each with specific layout implications, primarily concerning spacing around the symbol:\n\n*   **`normal`**: Standard variables or numbers; no special spacing around them.\n*   **`punctuation`**: Symbols like commas or semicolons; typically tight spacing to the left, some space to the right.\n*   **`opening`**: Symbols like `(` or `[`; typically tight spacing to the left, some space to the right.\n*   **`closing`**: Symbols like `)` or `]`; typically some space to the left, tight spacing to the right.\n*   **`fence`**: Symbols that act as both opening and closing delimiters, like `|` in absolute value; typically equal spacing on both sides, or tight against adjacent content within delimiters.\n*   **`large`**: Large operators like `sum` or `prod`; often have display-style variants and take up more vertical space.\n*   **`relation`**: Relational operators like `=` or `<`; typically have symmetric space on both sides.\n*   **`unary`**: Unary operators like `+` (in `+x`) or `-` (in `-y`); typically have different spacing depending on context (e.g., if they are binary or unary).\n*   **`binary`**: Binary operators like `+` (in `x+y`) or `-` (in `x-y`); typically have symmetric space on both sides.\n*   **`vary`**: Symbols whose class can vary based on context."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "I'm creating a custom math operator, `\myint`. I want it to behave like a standard binary operator (e.g., `+` or `-`) in terms of spacing. How would I define `\myint` and apply the correct math class using a show rule?",
    "answer": "To make your custom operator `\myint` behave like a binary operator, you should define it and then use a `#show` rule with `math.class.with(\"binary\")`.\n\ntyp```typ\n#let myint = symbol(\"\\u{222B}\") // Example: Using a unicode integral symbol\n\n#show myint: math.class.with(\"binary\")\n\n$a myint b myint c$\n```\n\nThis will ensure that `\myint` has the appropriate spacing on both sides, similar to `+` or `-`."
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Demonstrate the effects of different math classes ('normal', 'punctuation', 'opening', 'closing', 'fence', 'large', 'relation', 'unary', 'binary', 'vary') on a generic symbol 'b' using the `class()` function within a single Typst math block.",
    "answer": "Here's a demonstration of how each of the specified classes affects the spacing and potential alignment of a symbol `b`:\n\ntyp```typ\n$\na b c\\\na class(\"normal\", b) c\\\na class(\"punctuation\", b) c\\\na class(\"opening\", b) c\\\na lr(b c]) c\\ // For comparison: default lr behavior\na lr(class(\"opening\", b) c ]) c\\ // Notice the vertical shift when explicitly 'opening'\na class(\"closing\", b) c\\\na class(\"fence\", b) c\\\na class(\"large\", b) c\\\na class(\"relation\", b) c\\\na class(\"unary\", b) c\\\na class(\"binary\", b) c\\\na class(\"vary\", b) c\\\n$\n```\n\nThis code directly illustrates the examples from the documentation, showing how `class()` overrides the default behavior, particularly noticeable in spacing variations and the vertical adjustment when `class(\"opening\", b)` is used within `lr()`."
