#lorem(15) // Some placeholder text before the math

This is a long fraction that might look cramped: $display(1)/display(1+x^n)$. It's often better to add spacing.

// Using a box with inset for better spacing
#lorem(15) // Some placeholder text before the math

This is the same fraction but with improved spacing: #box($display(1)/display(1+x^n)$, inset: 0.2em). It's much easier to read now.

#lorem(20) // Some placeholder text after the math
