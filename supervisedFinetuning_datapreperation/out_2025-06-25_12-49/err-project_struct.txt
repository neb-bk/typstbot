    "instruction": "Explain the recommended project structure for a large Typst document, including the purpose of each file and how they interact.",
    "answer": "For managing large Typst documents, a structured approach is recommended, typically involving the following files:\n\n1.  **template.typ:** This file holds all the useful functions and variables you'll use across chapters. This includes things like custom document templates, styling definitions, and author information. This file is designed to be imported by other files to make the functions available.\n\n```typ\n// template.typ\n\n#let template = doc => {\n    set page(header: \"My super document\")\n    show \"physics\": \"magic\"\n    doc\n}\n\n#let info-block = block.with(stroke: blue, fill: blue.lighten(70%))\n#let author = \"@sitandr\"\n```\n\n2.  **main.typ:** This file serves as the entry point for compiling the entire document. It imports the template file and includes the individual chapter files. This file usually defines the document title.\n\n```typ\n// main.typ\n\n#import \"template.typ\": *\n// if you have a template\n#show: template\n\n= This is the document title\n\n// some additional formatting\n\n#show emph: set text(blue)\n\n// but don't define functions or variables there!\n// chapters will not see it\n\n// Now the chapters themselves as some Typst content\n#include(\"chapters/chapter_1.typ\")\n#include(\"chapters/chapter_1.typ\")\n```\n\n3.  **chapters/\*.typ:** These files contain the actual content of each chapter. They import the `template.typ` to access shared functions and variables. Chapters are designed to be modular and independent, only interacting through the `template.typ`.\n\n```typ\n// chapter_1.typ\n\n#import \"../template.typ\": *\n\nThat's just content with _styling_ and blocks:\n\n#infoblock[Some information].\n\n// just any content you want to include in the document\n```\n\nThis structure promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability for large Typst projects."

    "instruction": "How do chapters in a multi-file Typst project interact with each other and the template file? Provide an example.",
    "answer": "Chapters in a multi-file Typst project interact with each other and the template file through imports. Chapters can only see what they created themselves or imported.  The `template.typ` file acts as a central hub for shared functions and variables. Chapters import the template to gain access to these shared elements.\n\nHere's an example demonstrating how chapters and the template work together:\n\n1.  **template.typ:** Defines a document template, a custom block, and author information.\n\n```typ\n// template.typ\n\n#let template = doc => {\n    set page(header: \"My Super Document\")\n    doc\n}\n\n#let info-block = block.with(stroke: blue, fill: blue.lighten(70%))\n#let author = \"@sitandr\"\n```\n\n2.  **main.typ:** Imports the template and includes the chapters.\n\n```typ\n// main.typ\n\n#import \"template.typ\": *\n#show: template\n\n= My Document\n\n#include(\"chapters/chapter_1.typ\")\n#include(\"chapters/chapter_2.typ\")\n```\n\n3.  **chapters/chapter\_1.typ:** Imports the template and uses the defined `info-block`.\n\n```typ\n// chapter_1.typ\n\n#import \"../template.typ\": *\n\n#info-block[This is chapter 1 content].\n```\n\n4.  **chapters/chapter\_2.typ:** Also imports the template and uses the defined `info-block`.\n\n```typ\n// chapter_2.typ\n\n#import \"../template.typ\": *\n\n#info-block[This is chapter 2 content, authored by #author].\n```\n\nIn this setup, both `chapter_1.typ` and `chapter_2.typ` have access to the `info-block` function and the `author` variable defined in `template.typ` through the import statement. This promotes code reuse and consistency across the document."

    "instruction": "Explain the role of the `main.typ` file in a multi-file Typst project and provide a basic example.",
    "answer": "The `main.typ` file serves as the entry point for compiling a multi-file Typst document. It's the file you compile to produce the final output. Its primary responsibilities include:\n\n1.  **Importing the Template:** Importing the `template.typ` file (or whatever file defines your document-wide styles, functions, and settings) to make these available to the rest of the document.\n2.  **Setting the Document Template:** Using the `#show` function to apply a document template if one is defined in the template file.\n3.  **Including Chapter Files:** Using the `#include` function to incorporate the content of individual chapter files into the main document.\n4.  **Adding Document-Level Content:**  Optionally, adding any content that applies to the entire document, such as the title or global formatting overrides.\n\nHere's a basic example of a `main.typ` file:\n\n```typ\n// main.typ\n\n#import \"template.typ\": *\n\n#show: template\n\n= My Awesome Document\n\n#include(\"chapters/chapter_1.typ\")\n#include(\"chapters/chapter_2.typ\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `main.typ` imports the template, applies it to the document, sets a title, and then includes the content from `chapter_1.typ` and `chapter_2.typ`. When you compile `main.typ`, Typst will process all included files, assembling them into the final document."

    "instruction": "Describe the purpose of the `template.typ` file in a multi-file Typst project. Include an example of what it might contain.",
    "answer": "The `template.typ` file in a multi-file Typst project is designed to hold all the useful functions, variables, and styling definitions that you want to use across your entire document. This promotes code reusability, consistency, and maintainability. Instead of repeating the same code in each chapter, you define it once in the template and import it into the other files.\n\nHere's what a `template.typ` file might contain:\n\n*   **Document Template:** A function that applies a consistent look and feel to your document, like setting headers, footers, and margins.\n*   **Custom Styles:** Definitions for custom text styles, block styles, and other visual elements that you want to use consistently throughout your document.\n*   **Helper Functions:**  Functions that perform common tasks, such as formatting dates, creating custom lists, or generating repetitive content.\n*   **Global Variables:** Variables that store information that's used across multiple chapters, such as the document title, author name, or other metadata.\n\nHere's an example of a `template.typ` file:\n\n```typ\n// template.typ\n\n#let template = doc => {\n  set page(header: [My Document Header], footer: [Page #counter.page])\n  doc\n}\n\n#let section = block.with(above: 1em, below: 0.5em, font: \"Arial\", size: 1.5em)\n\n#let author = \"John Doe\"\n```\n\nIn this example:\n\n*   `template` is a function that sets the page header and footer.\n*   `section` defines a style for section headings.\n*   `author` is a variable holding the author's name.\n\nWhen you import this `template.typ` file into your chapter files (e.g., `chapter_1.typ`), you gain access to the `template` function, the `section` style, and the `author` variable."

    "instruction": "What are the key considerations for a 'Chapter' file (e.g., chapter\_1.typ) in a multi-file Typst project?",
    "answer": "A 'Chapter' file (e.g., `chapter_1.typ`) in a multi-file Typst project is a modular unit containing the content for a specific chapter or section of your document. Here are the key considerations when creating and working with chapter files:\n\n1.  **Import the Template:**  The first line of a chapter file should typically import the `template.typ` file (or the file containing your shared definitions). This makes all the functions, styles, and variables defined in the template available for use in the chapter.\n\n```typ\n#import \"../template.typ\": *\n```\n\n2.  **Content Specific to the Chapter:**  The primary focus of a chapter file is to contain the content specific to that chapter, including text, images, equations, tables, and other elements.\n\n3.  **Use Shared Definitions:** Utilize the functions, styles, and variables defined in the `template.typ` file to maintain consistency and avoid repeating code. For example, use the `section` style defined in the template for chapter headings, or the `author` variable for the author's name.\n\n```typ\n#import \"../template.typ\": *\n\n#section[Chapter Title]\n\nThis is the content of chapter one.\n#author\n```\n\n4.  **Maintain Modularity:** Design chapter files to be relatively independent of each other, focusing on the content within that chapter.  If there is a need for cross-chapter references, it's best handled in the template or by defining a dedicated file for shared references, and then importing it in the relevant chapters.\n\n5.  **Avoid Defining Shared Elements:** Don't define functions or variables in a chapter file that you intend to use in other chapters. These should be in the `template.typ` file.\n\n6.  **File Organization:**  Organize your chapter files logically, using descriptive names (e.g., `chapter_introduction.typ`, `chapter_methods.typ`) to reflect their content.\n\n7.  **Testing:** Test your chapter files individually and in the context of the complete document to ensure they render correctly and integrate seamlessly with the rest of the project.\n\nBy following these considerations, you can create well-organized, maintainable, and consistent Typst documents that are easy to navigate and update."

    "instruction": "What is the consequence of cyclic imports in Typst, and how can it be avoided?",
    "answer": "Typst strictly forbids cyclic imports. A cyclic import occurs when two or more files import each other, directly or indirectly (e.g., `chapter_1.typ` imports `chapter_2.typ`, and `chapter_2.typ` imports `chapter_1.typ`).\n\nThe consequence of cyclic imports is that Typst will raise an error during compilation. This is to prevent infinite loops during the import and compilation process, which could lead to unpredictable behavior.\n\nTo avoid cyclic imports, you must restructure your project to eliminate any circular dependencies. Here are some strategies:\n\n1.  **Centralized Definitions:** Move shared definitions (functions, variables, styles) into a single `template.typ` file.  This is the recommended approach, as it promotes modularity and avoids the need for cross-imports.\n2.  **Shared Helper Files:** If you have definitions that are needed by multiple files, but don't belong in the main template, create a separate file (e.g., `utils.typ` or `references.typ`) containing those definitions, and import this file where needed. This keeps your template file cleaner and more focused.\n3.  **Forward Declarations/Prototypes:** If you have a function in one file that needs to call a function defined in another file, you can use a forward declaration (also known as a prototype). Define the function signature in the first file, and then define the full function in the second file. This allows the first file to know about the function's existence without actually importing the second file.\n4.  **Refactoring:** Re-evaluate your project structure.  Sometimes, cyclic dependencies indicate that your files are not as modular as they could be. Break down complex files into smaller, more focused units that can be imported independently.\n\nBy carefully planning your project structure and following these guidelines, you can ensure that your Typst code remains free of cyclic import errors and that your documents compile successfully."
