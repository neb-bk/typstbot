## compile-typst

This is an agent skill for AnythingLLM that allows you to compile Typst code and retrieve possible error messages.

## Setup

1. Install the package by copying this folder to the correct location (refer to the Guide https://docs.anythingllm.com/agent/custom/introduction)
2. Activate the skill by clicking the toggle button in the AnythingLLM app under the "Agent Skills" section.

## Usage

Once installed, you can ask the AnythingLLM app via `@agent` to compile code using natural language.

```
@agent How do i create a table in typst?
```

```
@agent Can you tell me how to change the font in Typst?
```

```
@agent Give me some typst code for including an image as a figure.
```

The plugin will return the possible errors of the compiled code.
